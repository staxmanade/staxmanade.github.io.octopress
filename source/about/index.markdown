My name is Jason Jarrett. I've been a software developer since 2000, a technology enthusiast, husband, and father of 2. I'm a continuous learner who enjoys being challenged by new ideas and technologies. I work from my home office in Reno, NV for [Vertigo](http://vertigo.com) where I've been on teams that have shipped various apps on Xbox 360, Xbox One, iPhone/iPad, and many more I can't talk about publicly. I'm a member of the [ElegantCode](http://elegantcode.com) blogging community and blog as topics and time arise.

My interests include following the new and shiny ([squirl](http://youtu.be/SSUXXzN26zg)) while focusing on lessons learned, best practices, and teachings of respected developers in the software community.

## Projects

- [Resgrid](http://resgrid.com/) - My partner [Shawn](http://www.designlimbo.com/) founded and I try to help out where I can. Resgrid is a...
    
    *Personnel, resource logistics and department management system designed for first responders, volunteer and career fire, EMS, Search and Rescue, HAZMAT, public safety and more.*

- [Share Data Inspector](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/share-data-inspector/c33bae47-43d7-4d1b-bbee-01f09850d6dc) Windows 8 application that   

    *Provides a deep dive into what data is being shared when you click on the share charm (Win+h keyboard shortcut) from within nearly any Windows 8 application.*


## OSS (Open Source Software)

- You can find most of my OSS work up on my [github/staxmanade](http://github.com/staxmanade) account.
- [ToTypeScriptD](https://github.com/ToTypeScriptD/ToTypeScriptD)
    
    *You can now generate TypeScript definition (*.d.ts) files from either .Net or .winmd assembly files. Allowing you to leverage these libraries in your TypeScript/JavaScript WinJS or other client side software applications with all the type safety and benefits of TypeScript.*

- [Approvals.NodeJS](https://github.com/approvals/Approvals.NodeJS) - Created an initial port of the [Approvals](http://approvaltests.com/) in [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)

- [NuGet Automation for DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/NugetAutomation/) - I threw together some scripts that automatically publish [NuGet packages](http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=TypeScript.DefinitelyTyped) when DefinitelyTyped TypeScript definitions are updated.

- [StatLight](http://statlight.codeplex.com) - In 2008, I founded a popular *(if you can call it popular given the # of people who used silverlight minus the number who cared about unit testing)* unit testing tool StatLight, which became the *de facto standard* when it came to running Silverlight (What is that?) unit tests on continuous integration servers.

- I contributed an initial port of the [Castle Project's](http://www.castleproject.org/) [DynamicProxy](http://www.castleproject.org/projects/dynamicproxy/) to Silverlight so that I could eventually contribute a Silverlight port of the [Moq](http://www.moqthis.com/) mock testing library which also paved the way for [Rhino Mocks](http://hibernatingrhinos.com/oss/rhino-mocks) to eventually be ported to Silverlight.

- I've continued to contribute in small ways to other libraries I've leveraged along the way including [MassTransit](http://masstransit-project.com/), [PSake](https://github.com/psake/psake), [SpecFlow](http://www.specflow.org/), [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped)
