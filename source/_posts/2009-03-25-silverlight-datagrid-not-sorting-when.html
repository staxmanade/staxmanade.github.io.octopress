<div class='post'>
<p>This may be common knowledge when working with a Silverlight DataGrid, or any grid control in .net. However, I fought through this lesson the other week.</p>  <p>We are using <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/CompositeWPF">Prism V2</a> in a business application at work. When databinding several grids to a presenter I tried to enable sorting and ran into an issue where the grid wouldn’t sort if the property being bound to was an IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;…</p>  <p>Once I changed the property’s type to a List&lt;T&gt; on the presentation model (and all the correct sorting xaml tags were set) the grid became sortable.</p>  <p>The other strange thing about this was I couldn’t find anything about it on the net… Is this something that is inherent with other data grids?</p>  </div>

IEnumerable does not have sort method but generic List have Sort method.</div>

I probably left a few details out of this post...<BR/><BR/>I Set the grid's allows sorting property to true and every cell was a custom data template with the SortMember path set</div>

That is weird. How are you doing the binding? Maybe it's just calling into the IList.Sort method? Seems like it should just use Enumerable.Sort though.</div>
