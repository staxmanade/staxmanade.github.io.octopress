<p>I’ve pushed the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq-contrib/source/detail?r=22">Silverlight Unity/Moq AutoMocker</a> into the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq-contrib/">moq-contrib</a> project.</p>  <p>Well the other day I need the automocker and ended up running into a bug that was in my old-old-old pre-release version of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq-contrib/">moq for Silverlight</a>, so I took the time to get the released version and re-compile the automocker.</p>  <p>I published it to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moq-contrib/">moq-contrib</a> project. Haven’t taken the time to create a binary release, but should be able to get latest build, execute the build.Silverlight.cmd and in the drops\Current-Silverlight should be Moq.Contrib.UnityAutoMocker.Silverlight.dll</p>  <p>Enjoy!</p>  </div>
