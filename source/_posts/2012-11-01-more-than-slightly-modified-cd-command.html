A while back I wrote about a <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2011/07/16/slightly-modified-cd-command-for-powershell/" target="_blank">Slightly modified “CD” Command for PowerShell</a>. <br />Since that point, I’ve made a number of updates and would like to share them.<br />The first change I made was to move the “CD” script in that post to a <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/DevMachineSetup/blob/master/GlobalScripts/Change-Directory.ps1" target="_blank">new location</a>. I’ve greatly extended how I setup my development environment and how my PowerShell environment is initialized. <br /><blockquote><span style="background-color: white;">If you’re interested in how I setup my PS profile, take a look at the readme. Combine the setup with some <a href="http://chocolatey.org/" target="_blank">Chocolatey</a> and some <a href="http://boxstarter.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">BoxStarter</a> and you’re on your way to an amazingly automated development environment setup.</span></blockquote>Now on to the features I’ve added to the CD command.<br /><ul><li>I often would do something like “CD $Profile” (which is a no-go because that is a file not a directory, but my intent was to get into the directory where the $Profile file lived).      <br />      <br />So I updated it so if you try to CD to a file, it will just take you to the directory where the file resides.       </li><li>If you try to CD into a folder that doesn’t exist, it now prompts you to create it. <em>You could bypass the prompt with a -force|-f flag.</em><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-60i1Gy9oDaI/UJKpYXRavXI/AAAAAAAAAbY/2hB0iIpFEmc/s1600-h/image6.png"><img alt="image" border="0" height="124" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-OcSX7gH6dz0/UJKpY8jiewI/AAAAAAAAAbg/zakK10j3HvU/image_thumb2.png?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="image" width="524" /></a>       </li><li>Lastly I fixed an issue reported by a commenter in the previous post about trying to CD into a folder with the same name as a history index. If you had a folder named “4” and you typed “CD 4” it previously wouldn’t take you the 4 directory, but instead lookup item 4 in your CD history and take you there. Now if you specify a number and that number lives in the current directory it will take precedence over your history value. <em>(To be fair, I only added this feature, and even since I originally wrote about the CD command I have yet to run into a need for this case. Probably because I don’t name my directories with numbers)</em>. </li></ul>Something I had only recently noticed is this script appears to work with other PowerShell drive providers. I only did a cursory test but can CD into the HKLM:\Software\MyTestFolderThatShouldntExist and it will prompt to create the ‘folder’. If I say yes, I end up with a new registry folder. <img alt="Smile" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-eqb3EKYnXNo/UJKpadhpcFI/AAAAAAAAAbo/jBmQj4iLjgA/wlEmoticon-smile2.png?imgmax=800" style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-top-style: none;" /> Not sure how useful that is, but with the abstraction layer PowerShell drives give us it’s interesting.<br /><br />If you’d like to grab just the CD script you can download it here.    <br /><a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/DevMachineSetup/blob/master/GlobalScripts/Change-Directory.ps1">https://github.com/staxmanade/DevMachineSetup/blob/master/GlobalScripts/Change-Directory.ps1</a><br /><br />Happy system navigation with PowerShell.</div>
