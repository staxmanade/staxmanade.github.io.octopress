To host your blog for free by GitHub, you are not required to buy a custom domain so this is an optional step, but one I took.

The reason I have a complete post on this topic is primarily to say that I was able to accomplish this while not even at my desk.

While out waiting for my daughter to complete practice, I sat on my iPhone and was able to not only buy the domain name [staxmanade.com](http://staxmanade.com) but I also configured the CNAME on GitHub. By the time I got home from my daughters practice, I could hit my blog through the new domain [staxmanade.com](http://staxmanade.com). Exciting!

You can use [this post](http://codercorral.com/blog/2013/07/24/how-to-setup-a-custom-domain-with-octopress-slash-github-pages/) for a quick and simple walk through.
