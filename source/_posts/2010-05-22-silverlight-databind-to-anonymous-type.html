<p>I searched the web for the idea first. I was certain somebody had blogged about this before, and just wanted to quickly confirm it’s truth. Unfortunately all I came across were work-a-rounds and people telling you it’s not possible. So hopefully this post will help the next guy.</p>  <p>Since anonymous types are generated in an assembly as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7c5ka91b(VS.80).aspx">internal</a> types, by default, if you try to DataBind to an anonymous type, you’ll probably receive a binding error much like the following.</p>  <pre>System.Windows.Data Error: <br />    Cannot get 'Age' value (type 'System.Int32') from '{ Name = World, Age = 23 }' (type '&lt;&gt;f__AnonymousType0`2[System.String,System.Int32]'). <br />    BindingExpression: Path='Age' DataItem='{ Name = World, Age = 23 }' (HashCode=-172495608);<br />    target element is 'System.Windows.Controls.TextBlock' (Name=''); <br />    target property is 'Text' (type 'System.String').. <br />    System.MethodAccessException: Attempt by method 'System.Windows.CLRPropertyListener.get_Value()' <br />    to access method '&lt;&gt;f__AnonymousType0`2&lt;System.__Canon,System.Int32&gt;.get_Age()' failed.<br /><br />   at System.RuntimeMethodHandle.PerformSecurityCheck(Object obj,...<br />   at System.RuntimeMethodHandle.PerformSecurityCheck(Object obj,...<br />   at System.Reflection.RuntimeMethodInfo.Invoke(Object obj, Bind...<br />   at System.Reflection.RuntimeMethodInfo.Invoke(Object obj, Bind...<br />   at System.Reflection.RuntimePropertyInfo.GetValue(Object obj, ...<br />   at System.Reflection.RuntimePropertyInfo.GetValue(Object obj, ...<br />   at System.Windows.CLRPropertyListener.get_Value()<br />   at System.Windows.PropertyAccessPathStep.ConnectToPropertyInSo...</pre><br /><br /><h4>Turns out, it _IS_ possible to DataBind to an anonymous type in Silverlight.</h4><br /><br /><p>All you have to do is expose your privates. Placing the following into your AssemblyInfo.cs will give the built in bindings the ability DataBind to your object(s).</p><br /><br /><p><strong><br />    <br />[assembly: System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleTo(&quot;System.Windows&quot;)]</strong></p><br /><br /><p>&#160;</p><br /><br /><p>I’m not going to say whether this is or is not a good idea, and I’m sure there’s many ways to abuse it.</p><br /><br /><p>Don’t inhale too much of this stuff.</p>  </div>

What about dynamics, does the same trick apply to those kind of objects as well?</div>
