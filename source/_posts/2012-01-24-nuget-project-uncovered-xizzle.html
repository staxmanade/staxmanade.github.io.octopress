<blockquote>   <p>If you are coming to this series of posts for the first time you might check out <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2012/01/22/nuget-project-uncovered-an-introduction-to-the-series/" target="_blank">my introductory post</a> for a little context.</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/xizzle" target="_blank">xizzle</a> is a project that attempts to give you CSS-Like selector capability over arbitrary xml. This project first piqued my interest because I hoped it would be a light weight alternative to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fizzler/" target="_blank">fizzler</a> (Somebody should put fizzler on the NuGet feed. 1.2.3 not it). Unfortunately it isn’t quite there. Maybe someday xizzle will be strong enough to compete with fizzler but at the moment it doesn’t support nearly the amount of selector syntax that fizzler does and once I started playing with it I was mildly disappointed in its selector capabilities. Was probably written to get a certain class selector options accomplished and the writer just didn’t need all that much support yet. But I think there’s some real potential for a project like this to push forward. Lightweight, all included easy syntax.</p></div>
