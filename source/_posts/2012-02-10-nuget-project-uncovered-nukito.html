<blockquote>   <p>If you are coming to this series of posts for the first time you might check out <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2012/01/22/nuget-project-uncovered-an-introduction-to-the-series/" target="_blank">my introductory post</a> for a little context.</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Nukito" target="_blank">Nukito</a> is a project that’s taking AutoMocking to another level and baking it into the tooling/framework. If you use xUnit and Moq and want to avoid much of your redundant mock setup/verify code. You might want to take a look at this project.</p>  <p>I didn’t dig very deep into this project, but it smells somewhat like <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/AutoFixture" target="_blank">AutoFixture</a> which I believe has more support for other frameworks and is a bit more popular. (Again I didn’t dig deep enough to understand the core differences).</p>  </div>
