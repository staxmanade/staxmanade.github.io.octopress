<p>If you follow any of the big .Net blog aggregators, (<a href="http://codebetter.com/">CodeBetter</a>, <a href="http://www.lostechies.com">LosTechies</a>, etc…) you probably already follow and saw my invitation to join the bloggers over at <a href="http://elegantcode.com/">ElegantCode</a>.</p>  <p>My current thought is to publish in both locations… We’ll see how that goes.</p>  </div>
