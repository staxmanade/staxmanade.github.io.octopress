<blockquote>   <p>If you are coming to this series of posts for the first time you might check out <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2012/01/22/nuget-project-uncovered-an-introduction-to-the-series/" target="_blank">my introductory post</a> for a little context.</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/DynamicXaml" target="_blank">DynamicXaml</a> takes a fluent approach to building up xaml in code. Following the pattern laid down by the <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/HtmlTags" target="_blank">HtmlTags</a> project, this project provides a very clean way to write out your xaml code in C#.</p>  <p>I’ve copied a sample from the <a href="https://github.com/flq/XamlTags" target="_blank">github readme</a> below.</p>  <blockquote>   <pre><code>var _builder = new XamBuilder();<br />var button = <br />  _builder.Start&lt;Button&gt;()<br />    .Margin(&quot;5,0&quot;)<br />    .WidthAndHeight(200d,30d)<br />    .Create();</code></pre><br /></blockquote><br /><br /><p>One of the things I like about these projects is if you can’t use markup and are pushed to write your xaml in C#, you can apply some great tricks to reduce duplication with your code. (Not sure how this library works out, but I would suspect that if you created a default Button object, it would allow you to override specific properties one at a time or extend with new properties. This way you can create your base controls and only tweak as necessary.</p>  </div>
