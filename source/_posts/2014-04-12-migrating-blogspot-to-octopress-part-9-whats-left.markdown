Now that I've migrated to Octopress, I'm in the process of finding my new blogging flow.

I'm currently editing markdown post drafts in a [DropBox folder](https://db.tt/NRNuL3PX). I have been leveraging some of the following tools to write MarkDown.

- Windows
  - [dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io) (has [DropBox](https://db.tt/NRNuL3PX) support)
  - [MarkPad](http://code52.org/DownmarkerWPF/)
  - [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- Mac
  - [dillinger.io](http://dillinger.io) (has [DropBox](https://db.tt/NRNuL3PX) support)
  - [Mou](http://mouapp.com/)
- iPhone
  - [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/) (has [DropBox](https://db.tt/NRNuL3PX) support)

My worry is that some of these don't have the best spell-check support - so here's hoping I double-check my work along the way.
