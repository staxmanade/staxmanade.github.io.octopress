After hosting my blog on [BlogSpot.com](http://blogspot.com) for over 5 years, it was time to move.

As someone with the development background I have and constantly growing knowledge of the web, it always bugged me that my blog was hosted on BlogSpot. 

When I first started blogging over 5 years ago, it was a great starter site. Free, simple, easy to configure and it was a great place to throw content up with very little friction. But my desire to write posts using [Markdown](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), host my content on a site where I felt like I had complete control, and lets face it, I just wanted a codebase I could tinker with and throw up coding experiments.

I recently completed migration of my [staxmanade.blogspot.com](http://staxmanade.blogspot.com) site to its new location here on [staxmanade.com](http://staxmanade.com) which is graciously being hosted for free by [GitHub](https://github.com).

If you currently have a blog on BlogSpot/Blogger and are interested in migrating to Octopress or any other blog, the following series of posts may be of use.
