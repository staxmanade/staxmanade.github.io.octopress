<div class='post'>
I had some time to play around with and learn WPF within Silverlight. It's a modest start, but I just had to blog about it...<br /><br />We've started a project at my current job using Silverlight. Researching different framework options I ran across the <a href="http://codeplex.com/UnitDriven">UnitDriven</a> project on codeplex. After downloading and checking out the silverlight testing UI...<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SLo1BRz-hyI/AAAAAAAAAAQ/u2fJw1V0ivw/s1600-h/Csla.net.Original.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SLo1BRz-hyI/AAAAAAAAAAQ/u2fJw1V0ivw/s320/Csla.net.Original.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5240559412476544802" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I decided this was a place I could take a stab at learning some silverlight UI. ok... So it's getting late and it's certainly not perfect, but here's where I am now.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SLo1XFQ2E0I/AAAAAAAAAAY/7_HbNVjZ9Ss/s1600-h/Csla.net.NewSkin.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SLo1XFQ2E0I/AAAAAAAAAAY/7_HbNVjZ9Ss/s320/Csla.net.NewSkin.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5240559787065086786" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The only really tricky piece was... The original UI used nested ListBox controls which threw me down a path of thinking the program was broken... basically with a ListBox inside of a ListBox you have to select the first item, then the sub item, and in this application, only then, can you select the "Run" button to execute the unit test... I spent time looking through code trying to figure out if there was a bug in the testing contexts.<br /><br />The solution to this was to convert the ListBox to an ItemsControl. Which allowed me to select multiple buttons without having to first select the ListBox sub item...<br /><br />I then had to wrap everything inside of a ScrollViewer because the ItemsControl doesn't create one automatically like the ListBox does.<br />[EDIT]<br />Unfortunately wrapping everything in the ScrollViewer removed a feature the older version had, namely, at the top of the control is a display of the # succeeded/# Total. Wrapping everything in the ScrollViewer removed the ability to scroll through tests while that value was being updated during tests...<br /><br />So I updated the main grid in the XAML, and shifted a few things around to allow this old feature to be seen in the new UI.<br />[/EDIT]<br /><br />after that was done, it was basically playing around with different styling elements to end up with the UI above.<br /><br />It was a good simple exploratoin into some of the Silverlight's WPF capabilities.</div>
