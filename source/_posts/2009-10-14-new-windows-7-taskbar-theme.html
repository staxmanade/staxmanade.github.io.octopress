<p>I came back to my computer after some time and noticed what looked like a new theme on my windows 7 taskbar…</p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SsmHj8pVO1I/AAAAAAAAAL8/jI3x_PR0bnU/s1600-h/image10.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SsmHkEx1LsI/AAAAAAAAAMA/lRwORCfnbz4/image_thumb6.png?imgmax=800" width="704" height="25" /></a> </p>  <p>Turns out it was just a cmd.exe window that had been moved down a little and was showing through the see-through taskbar… Either way I thought it was interesting :)</p>  </div>
