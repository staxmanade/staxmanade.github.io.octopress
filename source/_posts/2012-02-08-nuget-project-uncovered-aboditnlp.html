<blockquote>   <p>If you are coming to this series of posts for the first time you might check out <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2012/01/22/nuget-project-uncovered-an-introduction-to-the-series/" target="_blank">my introductory post</a> for a little context.</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/AboditNLP" target="_blank">AboditNLP</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing" target="_blank">Natural Language Processor</a> library. This kind of stuff in interesting, but not something I have chosen to spend my time on.</p>  <p>It has a demo <a href="http://nlp.abodit.com/home/demo">http://nlp.abodit.com/home/demo</a> which gives you sample things to type to the library. I noticed it was a bit case sensitive, but still, project is one to look into if you were to say build a home automation system.</p></div>
