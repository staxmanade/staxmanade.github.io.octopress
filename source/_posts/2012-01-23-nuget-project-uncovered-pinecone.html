<blockquote>   <p>If you are coming to this series of posts for the first time you might check out <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2012/01/22/nuget-project-uncovered-an-introduction-to-the-series/" target="_blank">my introductory post</a> for a little context.</p> </blockquote>  <p>I found a description from a <a href="http://daniel.wertheim.se/2011/05/18/pinecone-project/" target="_blank">blog post</a> for this project:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>PineCone lets you take a C# class and then builds a schema for this class. This schema contains cached members that via <em>IL Emit</em> extracts all simple values from the object graph. All values are turned into a <em>StructureIndex</em>, which is contained by a <em>Structure</em>. Each StructureIndex holds a Guid pointing back to the structure so that you easily can navigate to the structure again.       <br /><a href="http://danielwertheim.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/pinecone.png"><img title="PineCone" alt="" src="http://danielwertheim.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/pinecone.png?w=300&amp;h=225" width="300" height="225" /></a></p> </blockquote>  <p>Itâ€™s described as a component used in <a href="http://sisodb.com/">http://sisodb.com/</a> (which itself looked interesting) and he may use it on other projects.</p>  </div>
