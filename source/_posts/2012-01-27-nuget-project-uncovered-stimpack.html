<blockquote>   <p>If you are coming to this series of posts for the first time you might check out <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2012/01/22/nuget-project-uncovered-an-introduction-to-the-series/" target="_blank">my introductory post</a> for a little context.</p> </blockquote>  <p><a href="http://nuget.org/packages/Stimpack" target="_blank">Stimpack</a> is another project leveraging <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609" target="_blank">ReactiveExtensions (RX)</a>. It’s based off of <a href="http://www.reactiveui.net/" target="_blank">ReactiveUI</a> and has some interesting concepts for consideration with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel" target="_blank">MVVM</a> pattern. </p>  <p>This was probably originally added to my To-Research list mostly because of the RX factor.</p>  <p>I didn’t find an good sample project on how to use it, but if you read through the <a href="https://github.com/shishkin/Stimpack/tree/master/Stimpack.Tests" target="_blank">fairly clean test project</a> you can probably figure out anything you need.</p>  </div>
