<p>This one was just too funny to not write down. The epitome of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_fart">Brain Fart</a>.</p>  <p>There sure seem to be quote a few posts lately talking about the Software (Crafts-Man/Woman/person/whatever); I may have many many more years of Craft practicum to study up on before I can truly consider myself a Craftsman. However, it’s humbling to screw up and remember that we are human. Below is one such story. Luckily there was no software, business value, or puppies hurt in the process.</p>  <h4>Setup:</h4>  <p>I work from home part time. Where I usually just remote desktop into my 64bit, quad-core, 12 gig of ram, supercomputer desktop at work. (I’m sure I’ll read this post in the future and go what? supercomputer? you have no idea young man.) I choose the RDP network latency over not being able to compile (in under XXX_too_much_time_XXX) on my laptop at home. (It’s part time one day a week and not worth the investment to beef up the home setup. -- yet) <strong>Point is: I’m working from home and via remote desktop on my computer at the office</strong>.</p>  <p>So I’m working on this project and…let’s just say I somehow got into a position where I thought my best option was to take my solution offline from TFS. (long story I don’t want to overshadow the “Brain Fart” part of this post)</p>  <p>This is where I got into trouble…</p>  <h4>How do I take my solution offline from TFS?</h4>  <p>I searched for how to take my solution offline and found this great post “<a href="http://ozgrant.com/2008/06/01/force-visual-studio-to-think-tfs-is-offline/">Force Visual Studio to think TFS is offline</a>” which outlines several options…</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Option 1 – Use the ‘tfpt tweakui’ utility</p>    <p>Option 2 – Yank the network cable before starting Visual Studio</p>    <p>Option 3 – Set a registry key</p> </blockquote>  <p><strong>Option 1:</strong> I didn’t think I had TFS Power Tools installed (turns out I did, just didn’t spend the 2 seconds to figure it out - doh).</p>  <p><strong>Option 3</strong>: I couldn’t seem to get the registry key version to work (for some reason???) &amp; wasn’t interested in wasting the day to figure it out.</p>  <p><strong>--- So what was left?</strong></p>  <p><strong>Option 2</strong>: “Yank the network cable before starting Visual Studio”. I didn’t yank the cord because clearly I’m not at the office so how could I do that????, but tried the next best thing. <strong>I disabled my network connection </strong>(so I could open the solution and have it NOT find TFS)<strong>.</strong></p>  <p><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" src="http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd272/Solblade44/You%20Fail/fail-i-told-you.jpg" /></p>  <p>If you missed the detail earlier in the post – I said that I was working through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol">RDP</a>. </p>  <p>Huh - Not anymore… Sigh!</p>  <p>Some days it may just be safer to work from home (disconnected from the world).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h5>P.S. thanks to a co-worker for getting me back online :)</h5>  </div>

I know there is (supposed to be this button) but for some reason whenever I&#39;m on a machine with Visual Studio &amp; TFS It&#39;s never there... :)</div>

What&#39;s even worse is that there&#39;s a little button on the top of the Solution Explorer when you have a project that&#39;s associated with TFS and you just click it ;)</div>
