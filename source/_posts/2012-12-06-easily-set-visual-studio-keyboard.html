<div class='post'>
<p>After a fresh install of Visual Studio, I often re-configure some options and setup keyboard bindings. This tends to be a bit of a pain as each and every time I have to remember what setting is in what U.I. configuration pane and how do I find/configure that again? I also will often forget about certain settings until the point I need them and it really breaks my coding rhythm down to go hunt for and reconfigure these options.</p>  <p>I recently found a simple solution to get my VS just the way I want it.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>P.S. Some of you may want to tell me all about the VS import/export settings, and you may be right, but I just haven’t spent the time to use/understand/easily find a way to integrate it into my ‘flow’.</p> </blockquote>  <p>So I present to you “MY happy path” to Visual Studio Environment configuration.</p>  <h4>1. Install the NuGet Package Manager Extension</h4>  <p>You’re going to probably install this extension anyway, so go-ahead and <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget">install it now</a> if you don’t already have it… We need this so you can get access to the NuGet Package Manager Console</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-leOq9kWDh78/UMDKoOAS6vI/AAAAAAAAAb8/xUeM3ZRRhfo/s1600-h/image3.png"><img title="image" style="border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-vDO9vE_i-y4/UMDKohZ5WdI/AAAAAAAAAcE/6kWeoto-_ao/image_thumb1.png?imgmax=800" width="745" height="209" /></a></p>  <h4>2. Execute Function Set-VisualStudioEnvironmentConfiguration</h4>  <p>Wait! What is “<a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/DevMachineSetup/blob/master/GlobalScripts/Set-VisualStudioEnvironmentConfiguration.ps1">Set-VisualStudioEnvironmentConfiguration</a>”?</p>  <p>This is a little function that I have in <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/DevMachineSetup">My PowerShell $Profile</a> which gets setup on all development environment.</p>  <h4>So what’s in this PowerShell script?</h4>  <p>As of writing this, I only have two specific setup commands, but thought I’d share as an example of what you can do:</p>  <ol>   <li>Set a keyboard binding to a specific command.      <pre># Map Ctrl+W to close a tab<br />$DTE.Commands.Item(&quot;File.Close&quot;).Bindings = &quot;Global::Ctrl+W&quot;;</pre><br />  </li><br /><br />  <li>ShowLineNumbers for all language files. <br />    <pre># Turn on line numbers for ALL language types<br />($DTE.Properties(&quot;TextEditor&quot;, &quot;AllLanguages&quot;) | where {$_.Name -eq &quot;ShowLineNumbers&quot; } ).Value = $true</pre><br />  </li><br /><br />  <li>Turn on whitespace? <br />    <pre># This doesn't work and I wish it did... <br />$DTE.ExecuteCommand(&quot;Edit.ViewWhiteSpace&quot;)<br /># Fails with: &quot;Command &quot;Edit.ViewWhiteSpace&quot; is not available.&quot;<br /># <strong>Maybe one of you can help me out?</strong></pre><br /><br />    <h4><br />      <ol>How can I find and setup the settings I like?</ol><br />    </h4><br />I’m no VS expert and only know as much about the $DTE object as what I’ve written about here, but I’ll give you some tips and you can go from there… </li><br /></ol><br /><br /><ul><br />  <li>Google/Bing are your friends. Type “DTE Visual Studio {TheThingYouWantToAccomplish}” </li><br /><br />  <li>After your search, most examples you find will be VB macros and as it turns out VB (in this case) translates nicely to PowerShell (EX:&#160; <br /><font size="3" face="Cordia New">&#160; VB Macro:&#160; DTE.Commands.Item(&quot;File.Close&quot;).Bindings = &quot;Global::Ctrl+W&quot; <br />      <br />PowerShell: <strong>$</strong>DTE.Commands.Item(&quot;File.Close&quot;).Bindings = &quot;Global::Ctrl+W&quot; <br /><br />      <br /></font>See the difference? (yep just the ‘$’ at the beginning of the PowerShell one) Nifty eh? </li><br /><br />  <li>Don’t be afraid to use PowerShell to search/filter things in the $DTE. Try this: <br />    <br /><font size="3" face="Cordia New">PM&gt;&#160; $DTE.Commands | <strong>where { $_.Name –match ‘Close’</strong> } | select { $_.Name } <br /><br />      <br /></font></li><br /></ul><br /><br /><ul>Happy VS Environment setting-uppers!</ul>  </div>
