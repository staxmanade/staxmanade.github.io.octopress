If you have a class that needs to expose some value (either by a Property, or a "getter" function) and there is a chance that getting this value could cause an exception. How do you best expose that value?<br /><br />I originally had a Property that exposed some value where, if in a certain state, would throw an exception.<br /><br />Microsoft FxCop recommends.<br />"Do not explicitly raise exceptions from unexpected<br />                   locations. There are some methods, such as Equals and<br />                   GetHashCode, which users do not expect to raise exceptions.<br />                    Therefore calls to these methods are not commonly<br />                   wrapped in try catch blocks."<br /><br />So if FxCop recommends not raising an exception from a Property's getter, we'll just throw it in a function. Come to find out now FxCop says...<br /><br />"Properties should be used instead of Get/Set methods<br />                   in most situations. Methods are preferable to properties<br />                   in the following situations: the operation is a conversion,<br />                   is expensive or has an observable side-effect; the<br />                   order of execution is important; calling the member<br />                   twice in succession creates different results; a member<br />                   is static but returns a mutable value; or the member<br />                   returns an array."<br /><br />...<br /><br />So, which is the best method?<br /><br />I went back to the Property method because it really is mimicking the usage of a property...<br /><br />Any suggestions out there?</div>
