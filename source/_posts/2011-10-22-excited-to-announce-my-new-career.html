<p>I have lots of bittersweet and mushy things to say about my previous employer of 5 years, however I’ll spare you from all that.</p>  <p>Last Monday (10/17/2011) I started my first official day with</p>  <p><a href="http://vertigo.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://vertigo.com/images/logo/7BAF4C_OV_Home.png" /></a> (That’s <a href="http://vertigo.com/" target="_blank">Vertigo</a>)</p>  <p>I’m really looking forward to working with the many great people at <a href="http://vertigo.com/" target="_blank">Vertigo</a> and all the interesting projects that will come my way.</p>  <p>With regards to this blog and my other OSS contributions, I don’t have any plans to change anything. I’m looking forward to possibly blogging about some different and interesting topics, but we’ll have to see.</p>  <p>Happy Coding!</p>  </div>
