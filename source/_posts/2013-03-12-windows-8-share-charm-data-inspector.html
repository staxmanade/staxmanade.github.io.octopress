<p>In a previous <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2013/03/03/windows-8-hackathon-good-for-participants-bad-for-microsoft/" target="_blank">post</a> I mentioned I would share the app I created during a Windows 8 hackathon event.</p>  <p>I spent some more time adding polish, testing, re-thinking my initial designs and today, I’m excited to say that it is now in the <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-US/app/share-data-inspector/c33bae47-43d7-4d1b-bbee-01f09850d6dc" target="_blank">app store</a>!</p>  <h4>What does this app do?</h4>  <p>The <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-US/app/share-data-inspector/c33bae47-43d7-4d1b-bbee-01f09850d6dc" target="_blank">Share Data Inspector</a> is an application that allows you to inspect the details of data being shared from other applications through the Windows 8 Share Charm (Win+H).</p>  <p>For example, if you open the <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/video/64b22df1-5a9c-4c88-aa1f-42cefaf8b281" target="_blank">Video</a> app, select a movie and use the share charm (Win+H) to share the video, what data is actually shared? The <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-US/app/share-data-inspector/c33bae47-43d7-4d1b-bbee-01f09850d6dc" target="_blank">Share Data Inspector</a> will appear up as an application you can share the just about any data with and you can inspect at a lower level what values are shared.</p>  <p><strong>This application will give you insights into data that you never thought was being shared.</strong></p>  <h4>How do I get the app?</h4>  <p>Open your Windows 8 App Store and search for “<a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-US/app/share-data-inspector/c33bae47-43d7-4d1b-bbee-01f09850d6dc" target="_blank">Share Data Inspector</a>”. (or click the link “View in Windows Store” button.</p>  <h4>I’d like to suggest a feature:</h4>  <p>If you’ve downloaded the trial app and would like to see some improvements. Head <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/ShareDataInspector/issues" target="_blank">over to this site, suggest a feature</a> and help this application grow from a hackathon created app into a full-fledged application.</p>  <p>Happy Sharing!</p>  </div>
