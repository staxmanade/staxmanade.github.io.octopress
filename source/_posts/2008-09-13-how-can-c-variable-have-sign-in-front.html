I remember a year ago I noticed in some code a coworker put together had a variable with an @ sign in front of it. At first I was baffled that it even compiled. I asked my c-worker about it and he said he had no clue as to why it was there and what it was for... so then I spent some time googling and couldn't find anything on the net describing this and why it compiled.<br /><br />basically what I'm talking about is if you have some code<br /><br />private void MyMethod(string myparam)<br />{<br />   int a = @myparam.Length;<br />}<br /><br />Notice the @ sign in front of the myparam variable... That is what I saw in my co-workers code and I couldn't explain how that worked...<br /><br />now, nearly a year later I was perusing through the SLUnity framework on codeplex [<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/unitycontributions">http://www.codeplex.com/unitycontributions</a>] and saw the @ sign again...<br /><br /><br />public void UnregisterSubscriber(string publishedEventName, EventHandler subscriber)<br />{<br />   PublishedEvent @event = GetEvent(publishedEventName);<br />   @event.RemoveSubscriber(subscriber);<br />   RemoveDeadEvents();<br />}<br /><br />I did some more googling and still can't find anything, (I'm sure it's out there, just can't put together the right search criteria)...<br /><br />Then I went back to the code, looked at it for a minute, and it dawned on me that "event" is a keyword in c#... Then I thought, maybe this is what you can do to use a C# keyword in another context than the desired reason to have the keyword.<br /><br />So I wrote a little test to see if this hypothesis was correct.<br /><br />private static void MyMethod(string class)<br />{<br />   int a = class.Length;<br />}<br /><br />this won't compile because of the "class" keyword...<br /><br />then I put the @ sign in front of class<br /><br />private static void MyMethod(string @class)<br />{<br />   int a = @class.Length;<br />}<br /><br />and it not only compiled, but you also get intellasense on the variable...<br /><br />How cool...<br /><br />I'm not sure I would do that on a regular basis, seems like it might be  a bit of a pain to write... However maybe framework code may need to have this to allow it to be more readable to it's consumers? Anyone know why on this?</div>

That is exactly what it is for, so you can use reserved words for variable names. You'll see this in some of the .NET framework even, with method parameters named @object in some places. I suspect it was added to C# specifically to be compatible with libraries written in other languages so that when it generates methods for you and uses the defined parameter name it won't have a compile error if it happens to be a C# keyword.</div>
