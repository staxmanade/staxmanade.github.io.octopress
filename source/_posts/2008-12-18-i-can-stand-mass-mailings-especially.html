I should have left the boxes checked. However when I tried that I got the same error :(</p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SU1GF8R1bgI/AAAAAAAAAEI/XSsgBF7T_Tw/s1600-h/image%5B5%5D.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="269" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SU1GG2nn3KI/AAAAAAAAAEM/qhVrd7dL4lQ/image_thumb%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="434" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>Apparently it's not a &quot;temporary problem&quot;... or they could define temporary since this has been there for several days now.</p>  </div>
