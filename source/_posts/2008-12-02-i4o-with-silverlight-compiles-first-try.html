<p>So I've been thinking lately of a problem that we will be solving at work that will require a user to follow these steps...</p>  <p>1. User selects some set of data to work with    <br />2. Some number crunching has to happen to give the user a report like interface     <br />3. User analyses that data, tweaks some value and will basically go to step 2 above...</p>  <p>This application is being build with <a href="http://silverlight.com/">Microsoft Silverlight</a> and in thinking about how to make step 2 above as smooth and responsive as possible, I thought &quot;Hey, what about i4o?&quot;</p>  <p>A quick Google for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GGLS_en-USUS299US303&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=I4o+silverlight" target="_blank">&quot;i4o Silverlight&quot;</a> and without digging too far I basically found nobody had tried it, or at least tried and told about i4o in Silverlight. So I thought I'd give a go...</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Step 1: Go get the code from from codeplex/i4o. I downloaded the latest <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/i4o/SourceControl/DownloadSourceCode.aspx?changeSetId=18968" target="_blank">source bits</a>.</p>  <p>Step 2: After extracting the .zip...Open up the project i4o.sln</p>  <p>Step 3: Add a new Silverlight class project</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/STYrrIMcDdI/AAAAAAAAAB8/IV4m45c9Xxg/s1600-h/image%5B18%5D.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="165" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/STYrrnDcSrI/AAAAAAAAACA/i9L43771l6o/image_thumb%5B12%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="244" border="0" /></a> </p> </blockquote>  <p>Step 4: Now use the &quot;Add existing item&quot; option to add files to the Silverlight project. Browse to the i4o project folder to select the 3 i4o class files. You can add those to you Silverlight project as is or use the &quot;Add as Link&quot; feature to share the code across the platforms.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/STYrsCqRHuI/AAAAAAAAACE/zyiseYEqdk0/s1600-h/image%5B17%5D.png"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="183" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/STYrs8EynfI/AAAAAAAAACI/pazWy0Tu47o/image_thumb%5B11%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="244" border="0" /></a>&#160;</p>  <p>Step 5: once you've add the files to the Silverlight project final step is to &quot;BUILD&quot; the solution...</p>  <p>What's that you say? &quot;That's all there was to it?&quot; YA, my thoughts exactly, the project just compiled on the first try...</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>DISCLAIMER: I haven't tried to use it yet... It's late and this idea popped into my head distracting me from getting to sleep. So I tried it and am quite satisfied for now.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Up NEXT: Don't know if I'll do this sooner than later, if at all, but figure out how hard it would be to port the existing unit tests to see how they run in Silverlight...</p>  </div>
