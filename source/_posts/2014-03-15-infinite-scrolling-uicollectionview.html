<div class='post'>
<p>The other day I set out to create an iOS UICollectionView that allowed a user to scroll vertically through an infinite-ish list of items where the data came from a paginated back-end web service. Most of the examples out there deal with synchronous in-memory. I needed an asynchronous paginated example.</p> <p>I&#8217;m new enough to iOS development that solutions don&#8217;t yet roll off the wire of my keyboard, so I still google for how others attack a problem and adapt their strategy to fit my needs.</p> <p>It seemed like it took me all day to track down the pieces I needed to put together a solution. But I found enough to put together a prototype.</p> <p>If you need something like this, I&#8217;ve pushed my prototype up to <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/PaginatedCollectionView">GitHub</a> and hopefully it&#8217;ll give you enough hints to get started on your own implementation.</p> <p>I&#8217;m open to feedback. Post any suggestions/alternative ideas to the github repo.</p> <h1>Where do I get it?</h1> <h2><a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/PaginatedCollectionView">HERE</a></h2> <p>Hope you find this useful.</p></div>
