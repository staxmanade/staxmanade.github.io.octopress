<p>I recently published a <a href="https://github.com/ToTypeScriptD/SampleWin8" target="_blank">little sample project</a> up in the <a href="https://github.com/ToTypeScriptD" target="_blank">ToTypeScriptD</a> github organization that walks through converting a new Windows 8 WinJS application to TypeScript.</p>  <p>It’s intended to show some of the basic first steps it takes to convert a project over to TypeScript and also how you can leverage <a href="https://github.com/ToTypeScriptD/ToTypeScriptD" target="_blank">ToTypeScriptD</a> to help automatically generate .d.ts based on the windows *.winmd assemblies.</p>  <p>If you’re writing any TypeScript WinJS apps, feel free to check it out. I’d appreciate any feedback you have that can improve on this guide’s steps/approach for porting an existing WinJS library over to TypeScript.</p>  <p>Happy Scripting!</p>  </div>
