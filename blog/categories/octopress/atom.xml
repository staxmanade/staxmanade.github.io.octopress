    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After hosting my blog on <a href="http://blogspot.com">BlogSpot.com</a> for over 5 years, it was time to move.</p>

<p>As someone with the development background I have and constantly growing knowledge of the web, it always bugged me that my blog was hosted on BlogSpot.</p>

<p>When I first started blogging over 5 years ago, it was a great starter site. Free, simple, easy to configure and it was a great place to throw content up with very little friction. But my desire to write posts using <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, host my content on a site where I felt like I had complete control, and lets face it, I just wanted a codebase I could tinker with and throw up coding experiments.</p>

<p>I recently completed migration of my <a href="http://staxmanade.blogspot.com">staxmanade.blogspot.com</a> site to its new location here on <a href="http://staxmanade.com">staxmanade.com</a> which is graciously being hosted for free by <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>If you currently have a blog on BlogSpot/Blogger and are interested in migrating to Octopress or any other blog, the following series of posts may be of use.</p>
