I don&#39;t have any sql server builds that I can test anymore. This was an old post and I&#39;ve since forgotten all about it&#8230; Looks like Microsoft closed it as &quot;won&#39;t fix&quot; http://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/434465/management-studio-can-display-connection-to-wrong-server</div>

Hi Jason,<br /><br />I tried to reproduce this bug in SSMS 2008 (10.0.5500.0), and the Connect option is disabled while the new query window is initializing. Looks like it&#39;s fixed to me.<br /><br />Please can you verify.<br />Thanks<br />Andy</div>

<p>My company has been developing out parts of our website using <a href="http://silverlight.com/" target="_blank">Silverlight</a> to enable some rich client LOB scenarios. Since the companies inception, we developed in a Scrum/Agile manner 3-6 week iterations. However, recently we started experimenting with a more “feature driven” attempt at “lean” approach. </p>  <p>With this new development approach, we made the decision that the trunk of the project’s source will be ready to deploy to production at all times. And as such would develop features out on branches. This is where the problem lies… We started running into a <a href="http://troyfarrell.com/blog/post/Maximum-file-path-length---Windows-and-TFS.aspx" target="_blank">“Maximum file path length…”</a> issue when branching the source. It’s a relatively old project (5 years or so now) with layers of projects/namespaces. </p>  <p>We traced the issue down to files generated by the Visual Studio’s Add Service Reference dialog.    <br /><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/Sd_UnpimHkI/AAAAAAAAAF4/2Pzl6l7mgD4/s1600-h/image%5B2%5D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="202" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/Sd_Un_Ie61I/AAAAAAAAAF8/jRJOfQb0rNI/image_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="244" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/Sd_UoJFQQoI/AAAAAAAAAGA/WvFyDYrCkKk/s1600-h/image%5B5%5D.png"><img title="image" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="188" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/Sd_UoYBaSGI/AAAAAAAAAGE/p6ei3NVsi20/image_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="244" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>In our case the generated files had the full namespace + service name which were, in some cases, greater than 90 characters long just for the file. Coupled with the fact they were already nested in a directory structure (that helped keep things organized). We ended bumping into the <a href="http://troyfarrell.com/blog/post/Maximum-file-path-length---Windows-and-TFS.aspx" target="_blank">“Maximum file path length…”</a> when trying to branch the project.</p>  <p>After researching a hunch I’d had</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Most of those files generated by the tool are garbage and never used, so why does VS generate them, and have to check them into TFS?</p>    <p>Here’s a good post describing the meta data files.     <br /><a href="http://www.scottseely.com/blog/09-01-26/Misunderstood_Add_Service_Reference.aspx">http://www.scottseely.com/blog/09-01-26/Misunderstood_Add_Service_Reference.aspx</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>I found out that the only thing we cared about was the “References.cs” file in that whole batch of files.</p>  <p>Now, we would like to, and have thought about writing our own code in place of using the VS generated, (I know I’ve heard from the WCF pros at <a href="http://www.idesign.net/" target="_blank">IDesign</a> that you should never use the “Add Service Reference” generated stuff…) however it does what we need with the exception of the super long file names generated and…every time we update the service reference it keeps trying to add the ServiceReferences.ClientConfig back into the project. Since we are not using a config file to store the WCF connection information. We are following a similar path you can read about here (<a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/mwatson/archive/2009/02/24/129655.aspx">http://geekswithblogs.net/mwatson/archive/2009/02/24/129655.aspx</a>) This way we don’t have to have separate configs for Dev/Test/Production. </p>  <p>The built in VS Service Reference tooling has become more of a hindrance to development than providing any benefit.</p>  <h4>What is the solution we came up with to these two issues?</h4>  <blockquote>   <p>What were the problems again?</p>    <p>1. Files generated by “Add Service Reference” tools are too long for TFS (Not the fault of the tool, more the fault of the (TFS/.net api/win api) for not supporting longer file names…</p>    <p>2. Every time we update/add new service reference it tries to re-add the ServiceReferences.ClientConfig file (DON”T WANT THAT)</p> </blockquote>  <p>After about 1/2 a day looking for alternatives to using the built in tool, and since the wcf svcutil doesn’t generate code Silverlight can use. I stumbled upon this blog <b><a href="http://www.atrevido.net/blog/2008/12/02/Command+Line+WCF+Proxy+Generation+For+Silverlight+2+RTM.aspx">Command line WCF Proxy Generation for Silverlight 2 RTM</a></b> where he figured out how to use the same dll VS uses to generate the source and wrapped it into a little console app… After chatting w/ him on his blog’s Live Messenger plugin, (very cool by the way) he emailed me the exe he’s using in his production app (that had a couple bug fixes since his original blog post. He told me just to use <a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector/" target="_blank">Reflector</a> to get at the source because it was very basic.</p>  <p>And so I did, and ended up with a pretty good solution to the problems above. (Sucks that I spent a day of dev time on this crap, but oh well…)</p>  <p>I wrote a T4 template that will generate all the reference.cs code needed in our Silverlight project. Instead of describing the template itself (since this post has gotten long alredy) I’ll include a project with a sample of how it works.</p>  <p>Some of the features you get using this template are:</p>  <ol>   <li>It solves the two issues stated above      <ol>       <li>Only one file generated.&#160; (None of the VS generated garbage metadata files)</li>        <li>No re-add of the ServiceReferences.ClientConfig file to the project.</li>     </ol>   </li>    <li>With the use of the T4 template (this is in our app, not in the sample below) you can put other logic needed when generating a service reference.      <ol>       <li>We are using it to update the Web.Config’s WCF aspnet compatibility flag so we can get at the wsdl and setting it back when done updating the service reference…          <br />&lt;serviceHostingEnvironment aspNetCompatibilityEnabled=&quot;true&quot;&gt; </li>     </ol>   </li>    <li>You can set some properties that will tell the tool to generate the types as “internal” (if you want)      <blockquote>       <p>Note: you have to add the correct InternalsVisibleTo for this to work</p>        <p>[assembly: System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InternalsVisibleTo(&quot;System.Runtime.Serialization&quot;)]          <br /></p>     </blockquote>   </li> </ol>  <p>Here’s the sample project with examples of both a normal reference, and the same reference using the T4 template.</p>  <p><iframe style="border-right: #dde5e9 1px solid; padding-right: 0px; border-top: #dde5e9 1px solid; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 3px; border-left: #dde5e9 1px solid; width: 240px; padding-top: 0px; border-bottom: #dde5e9 1px solid; height: 66px; background-color: #ffffff" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="http://cid-c0f357e4555270e7.skydrive.live.com/embedrowdetail.aspx/Public/CustomAddServiceReferenceSpike.zip" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>  <p>Hope this helps someone else…</p>  </div>

This was great.  We used the concept to modify the code dom and add DebuggerNonUser code attributes to every class.  This allowed us to ignore the web service proxies when performing code coverage.<br /><br />Thanks for the post.</div>

Jason,<br /><br />Awesome post, thanks. I just figured out that i couldn&#39;t use overloading on my wcf service methods. But if you create the reference.cs your self it is possible. But writing the whole service ref. is to time-costly. This is the perfect solution for that. Thanks for posting!<br /><br />Vincent Ottens</div>

James,<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re asking. If you read up on T4 templates, you should be able to find out that you can put any logic you want in there&#8230;</div>

<p>This may be common knowledge when working with a Silverlight DataGrid, or any grid control in .net. However, I fought through this lesson the other week.</p>  <p>We are using <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/CompositeWPF">Prism V2</a> in a business application at work. When databinding several grids to a presenter I tried to enable sorting and ran into an issue where the grid wouldn’t sort if the property being bound to was an IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;…</p>  <p>Once I changed the property’s type to a List&lt;T&gt; on the presentation model (and all the correct sorting xaml tags were set) the grid became sortable.</p>  <p>The other strange thing about this was I couldn’t find anything about it on the net… Is this something that is inherent with other data grids?</p>  </div>

IEnumerable does not have sort method but generic List have Sort method.</div>

I probably left a few details out of this post&#8230;<BR/><BR/>I Set the grid&#8217;s allows sorting property to true and every cell was a custom data template with the SortMember path set</div>

That is weird. How are you doing the binding? Maybe it&#8217;s just calling into the IList.Sort method? Seems like it should just use Enumerable.Sort though.</div>

<p>So today I was perusing my blog list and ran across a blog by Rick Strahl (<a href="http://www.west-wind.com/Weblog/posts/653034.aspx">Dynamic Delegates with Expression Trees</a>) which is referencing this post by Nate Kohari (<a href="http://kohari.org/2009/03/06/fast-late-bound-invocation-with-expression-trees/">Fast Late-Bound Invocation with Expression Trees</a>). </p>  <p>I first just thought it was a very interesting post and thought, “<em>wow, next time I have to do something requiring a ton of reflection method calls I’ll have to remember this”</em>. I took off with the family for the day and sometime during the day the idea popped into my head about trying it to read property’s values (since they are actually just a method call under the hood). And I do have the perfect place to try and spike this idea… </p>  <p>One of the things I’ve done to the i4o library is try to reduce the calls to reflection whenever possible. And the only one left that I couldn’t get past was having to use the PropertyInfo’s GetValue reflection call to get at a value for creating the property index. This generally isn’t a big deal because we only have to do it once, however it makes the initialization of the IndexableCollection&lt;T&gt; fairly expensive.</p>  <p>So I decided to spike the idea of using the DelegateFactory from Nate’s blog to read an object’s property values. And below I’m including the project that I spiked to test this idea out.</p>  <p>It compares how fast we can read values out of an object’s property by first using reflection and second using the dynamic delegate.</p>  <p>If you read Ricks post above, he mentions how the dynamic delegate idea is a little reflection expensive up front. However it only happens once and I ran a couple of tests…(p.s. i noticed a small flaw in my timing, however I don’t want to re-zip &amp; re-upload the spike… so if you see the timing flaw, cool…)</p>  <p>I noticed that after about the first 5000 reads the expense of the heavy up front reflection from DelegateFactory started to become negligent. And the more reads the more powerful the new reading strategy became. Take 1/5 million reads for example… normal reflection reading took .78 seconds, while the delegate reading took only .03 seconds which is a substantial increase.</p>  <p><iframe style="border-right: #dde5e9 1px solid; padding-right: 0px; border-top: #dde5e9 1px solid; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 3px; border-left: #dde5e9 1px solid; width: 240px; padding-top: 0px; border-bottom: #dde5e9 1px solid; height: 66px; background-color: #ffffff" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="http://cid-c0f357e4555270e7.skydrive.live.com/embedrowdetail.aspx/Public/PropertyReadSpike.zip" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>  <p>After that I spiked it in the i4o project and proved that this could significantly increase the index build time of the an IndexableCollection&lt;T&gt;. I shelved the spike and am having Aaron take a look at the idea. We’ll see, I haven’t come up with any reasons why this could cause any issues, so it may be included…</p>  </div>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been doing any Silverlight development, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re aware of the <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/silverlightut">Microsoft Silverlight Unit Test Framework</a>.</p>  <p>One extremely interesting aspect about this framework is how flexible it is for custom extension. If you didn&#8217;t already know, Jeff Wilcox put together a quick port of NUnit and created a project that would interface the nunit.framework.dll he ported with the Microsoft Silverlight Unit Test Framework. (<a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2009/01/nunit-and-silverlight/" target="_blank">post here</a>)</p>  <p><strong>Below I&#8217;ll explain a little about my port of the xUnit testing framework that is now hosted in the browser leveraging the </strong><a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/silverlightut"><strong>Microsoft Silverlight Unit Test Framework</strong></a><strong>. </strong></p>  <p>As far as WHAT is implemented with the xUnit for Silverlight and what you may have to figure out on your own (as I&#8217;m not all that familiar with xUnit) if you use it for your own project&#8230;</p>  <ol>   <li>FactAttribute ( obviously ) </li>    <li>FactAttribute.Skip ( [Ignore] in most frameworks ) </li>    <li>FactAttribute.Name (is mapped to the &quot;Description&quot; in the ms test harness) </li> </ol>  <p>That&#8217;s pretty much it&#8230; It doesn&#8217;t do anything as far as test Setup/Teardown as Moq (the project I needed xUnit in Silverlight for) didn&#8217;t need it, and because I&#8217;m not familiar enough with xUnit to really make this thing fully compatible.</p>  <p>So, here is XunitLight for Silverlight&#8230;    <br /><iframe style="border-right: #dde5e9 1px solid; padding-right: 0px; border-top: #dde5e9 1px solid; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 3px; border-left: #dde5e9 1px solid; width: 240px; padding-top: 0px; border-bottom: #dde5e9 1px solid; height: 66px; background-color: #ffffff" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="http://cid-c0f357e4555270e7.skydrive.live.com/embedrowdetail.aspx/Public/XunitLight.Silverlight.zip" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>  <p><strong>UPDATE: (2/9/2009)</strong> If you&#8217;d like to provide any updates to this project.

Hey Jonathan,<br /><br />Personally I&#8217;d like to see it built straight into xUnit, since it&#8217;s dependent on the xUnit source files. There&#8217;s a work-item to support silverlight on the xunit site, and a link to my blog, so hopefully someone over on xUnit team will get a kick and look a porting it for everyone&#8230;<br /><br />Also, I don&#8217;t use xUnit personally, and only wrote this quickly to get the tests to work while trying to port the Moq project.<br /><br />However if you or someone else gets it up and running w/ either xunit or xunit-contrib, I&#8217;ll surely remove my svn version.</div>

<p>If you read my previous post about <a href="/2009/02/fluent-specification-extensions">Fluent Specification Extensions</a> then you know that I&#8217;m still in an experimental phase of this idea.</p>  <p>I&#8217;d like to share one more positive I found by using the specification extensions in my testing framework. This benefit is there weather you use standard specification extension methods or try the fluent specification extensions. The idea is very basic, but I didn&#8217;t even realize it&#8217;s benefit until I ran into it directly.</p>  <p>And the great benefit is&#8230; (drum roll&#8230;errr..actually it&#8217;s not mind blowing). By using extensions methods to provide assertion extensions on the objects we&#8217;re testing, we&#8217;ve<strong> <u>abstracted the actual testing framework&#8217;s assertion process.</u></strong><u> </u>(told you it wasn&#8217;t mind blowing, but read along and see an example of how this abstraction could be good)</p>  <p>Now I know most times you won&#8217;t ever change testing frameworks, however I just ran into this when attempting to port the Castle.DynamicProxy2 (DP2) to Silverlight. Their test project leveraged the NUnit testing framework, which hasn&#8217;t officially been ported. You can find a quick <a href="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2009/01/nunit-and-silverlight/">port by Jeff Wilcox</a> that will run in the Microsoft Silverlight Unit Testing Framework. However when I was porting the DP2 that hadn&#8217;t been done, and I didn&#8217;t feel like porting NUnit at the time.</p>  <p>So, by providing this abstraction layer (through the extension methods). You could then go in and easily swap what testing framework your project is leveraging to do it&#8217;s assertions.</p>  <h6>NOTE: the port from NUnit to MSFT wouldn&#8217;t have been that easy as the [TestMethod] in MSFT is sealed so I couldn&#8217;t create a [Test] attribute that inherited from [TestMethod] to get the SL testing framework to run the tests w/out changing the DynamicProxy test code&#8230;aside from that issue&#8230;</h6>  <p>Let&#8217;s take a concrete example of this abstraction benefit.</p>  <p>Notice how the Assert.IsInstanceOfType() in both NUnit and Microsoft&#8217;s testing framework have the parameters reversed.</p>  <p>NUnit:</p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SY0lvWzbk4I/AAAAAAAAAEw/mikfS2Ad9TQ/s1600-h/image11%5B3%5D.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="146" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SY0lv1_mpxI/AAAAAAAAAE0/UMgoOPFIoiY/image11_thumb%5B2%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="584" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Microsoft:</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SY0lwEt7LjI/AAAAAAAAAE4/cj4aScmZML4/s1600-h/image17%5B1%5D.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="104" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_L6Vw0x_R3iw/SY0lwbo9p9I/AAAAAAAAAE8/xklqX1ujQj4/image17_thumb.png?imgmax=800" width="584" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>If you were trying to switch from NUnit to MSFT or visa versa, a simple search and replace on [Test] for [TestMethod] would suffice for the majority of the needed port. However the Assert.IsInstanceOfType() would fail at compile time because of the parameter order. (and who know what else exactly is different)</p>  <p>If you could provide that layer of abstraction for the assertions, then to switch between NUnit and MSFT or visa versa would remain very simple, as you would only have to provide the framework specific changes only once.</p>  </div>

<p><strong>FYI: If you&#8217;re familiar with extension methods, and how to use them in testing sceneries&#8230;the interesting part of this post is at the bottom starting at: &#8220;Ok, on to the point&#8230;&#8221;</strong></p><p>The C# extension methods give some amazing power when it comes to extending functionality of objects (we don&#8217;t own) and I&#8217;ve spotted a pattern on several blogs and example unit testing snippets, especially in the Context Specification style testing areas that I find interesting.   <br /><br />The concept is to basically use the C# extension methods within a unit testing environment to give the system under test (SUT) more readability/understandability within the test code itself.   <br /><br />Here&#8217;s an example of how you might normally write a unit test given the following SUT. </p>  <pre><span style="color:#0000ff;">public</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;">class</span> SystemUnderTest<br />{<br />  <span style="color:#0000ff;">public</span> SystemUnderTest() { PropertyUnderTest = "<span style="color:#8b0000;">Hello World!</span>"; }<br />  <span style="color:#0000ff;">public</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;">string</span> SomeStringProperty { <span style="color:#0000ff;">get</span>; <span style="color:#0000ff;">set</span>; }<br />  <span style="color:#0000ff;">public</span> <span style="color:#0000ff;">bool</span> SomeBoolProperty { <span style="color:#0000ff;">get</span>; <span style="color:#0000ff;">set</span>; }<br />}</pre><p>You might write some unit tests that might look like&#8230;</p><pre>var sut = <span style="color:#0000ff;">new</span> SystemUnderTest();<br /><br />Assert.IsTrue(sut.SomeBoolProperty);<br />Assert.AreEqual(sut.SomeStringProperty, "<span style="color:#8b0000;">Hello World!</span>");</pre><p>Now, the assertions above are small enough it&#8217;s pretty easy to tell what&#8217;s going on, however when you think about what your looking at, it actually present the best readability.</p><p>Let&#8217;s take the string&#8217;s AreEqual assertion for example&#8230;  You first read the &#8220;AreEqual&#8221;, so now you have to allocate some (undefined as of yet) space in your head to store some data points that need to be evaluated all at once. (maybe I&#8217;m getting lazy as I get old, but the less I have to think when reading tests the more time I can spend understanding the domain being tested&#8230;)</p><p>Again, the example is over simplified, but I think you get the point.</p><h4>What if you could make the test syntax read and flow in a very readable and understandable manner?</h4><p>That&#8217;s what the specification extensions give you. Given the two tests above and an a couple helper extension methods living in the testing library I could write something like.</p><pre>var sut = <span style="color:#0000ff;">new</span> SystemUnderTest();<br />sut.SomeBoolProperty.ShouldBeTrue();<br />sut.SomeBoolProperty.ShouldEqual("<span style="color:#8b0000;">Hello World!</span>");</pre><p>It may just be me, but that just feels better, is more understandable, and the great thing is I didn&#8217;t have to impact my domain objects to support this style of test&#8230;</p><p>Another great benefit is you don&#8217;t have to type &#8220;Assert.xxxx(YYzzz)&#8221; each time you want to create an assertion. You can just type sut.SomeThing.{this where you get help from intellasense} giving you some great context based assertion options.</p><p>I googled for a library that had a pre-built set of extension assertions and ended up finding the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/specunit-net/source/browse/">http://code.google.com/p/specunit-net/source/browse/</a> by Scott Bellware. If you dig into the source of the project you can find a helper class called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/specunit-net/source/browse/trunk/src/SpecUnit/SpecificationExtensions.cs" target="_blank">SpecificationExtensions.cs</a> which basically gives you all the &#8220;Should..{your assertion here}&#8221; extension methods.</p><h4>Ok, on to the point real point (sorry it&#8217;s taken so long).</h4><p>After downloading and playing with the extension specifications from Spec Unit, I thought what if we made that more fluent?</p><p>So I gave it a quick spike and instead of writing some tests that look like&#8230;</p><pre>sut.SomeStringProperty.ShouldNotBeNull();<br />sut.SomeStringProperty.ShouldBeOfType(<span style="color:#0000ff;">typeof</span>(<span style="color:#0000ff;">string</span>));<br />sut.SomeStringProperty.ShouldEqual("<span style="color:#8b0000;">Hello World!</span>"); </pre><p>You could have less wordy code and still retain all the meaning and readability with a set of fluent specification extensions.</p><pre>sut.SomeStringProperty<br />.ShouldNotBeNull()<br />.ShouldBeOfType(<span style="color:#0000ff;">typeof</span>(<span style="color:#0000ff;">string</span>))<br />.ShouldEqual("<span style="color:#8b0000;">Hello World!</span>");</pre><p>I haven&#8217;t figured out what sorts of bad things this style of assertion could bring&#8230; but we&#8217;ll experiment for a while&#8230;</p><p>Here&#8217;s an example console app with the extensions included.</p><p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: I haven&#8217;t tested all the extensions so if you notice any issues please feel free to let me know&#8230;<br /><br /><iframe style="border-right: #dde5e9 1px solid; padding-right: 0px; border-top: #dde5e9 1px solid; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 3px; border-left: #dde5e9 1px solid; width: 240px; padding-top: 0px; border-bottom: #dde5e9 1px solid; height: 66px; background-color: #ffffff" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="http://cid-c0f357e4555270e7.skydrive.live.com/embedrowdetail.aspx/Public/FluentSpecificationExtensions.zip" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p></div>

I just added this helpful extension method to my code. Thought of sharing it.<br /><br />public static IEnumerable ShouldContain(this IEnumerable collection, Func expectedCriteria)<br />        {<br />            collection.Any(expectedCriteria).ShouldBeTrue();<br />            return collection;<br />        }</div>

You might find this useful:<br /><br />http://code.google.com/p/shouldit/<br /><br />ShouldIt is an open source library of fluent specification extensions that can be used with any unit testing framework.</div>
