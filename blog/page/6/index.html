This project first piqued my interest because I hoped it would be a light weight alternative to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fizzler/" target="_blank">fizzler</a> (Somebody should put fizzler on the NuGet feed. 1.2.3 not it). Unfortunately it isn’t quite there. Maybe someday xizzle will be strong enough to compete with fizzler but at the moment it doesn’t support nearly the amount of selector syntax that fizzler does and once I started playing with it I was mildly disappointed in its selector capabilities. Was probably written to get a certain class selector options accomplished and the writer just didn’t need all that much support yet. But I think there’s some real potential for a project like this to push forward. Lightweight, all included easy syntax.</p></div>

<p>A while back I posted about <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2011/09/27/whats-happening-on-the-nuget-feed-leveraging-odata-in-an-rss-reader/" target="_blank">following the NuGet feed via an RSS reader</a>. For some strange reason I’ve been reviewing this feed since then on an almost daily basis in my RSS reader. Throughout that time I’ve kept a small list of what I think are interesting projects that have put out a release since that time. Today we’re going to start a journey through projects that I’ve found during my review of the feed. Some projects are interesting because I could find a use for them, some are interesting because they are unique, and others solve an interesting problem.</p>  <h4>Why were these packages chosen to post about over others?</h4>  <p>There wasn’t any scientific process in place to decide what projects made this list or not but as I think back over my time reviewing the feed, below are some items that came to mind.</p>  <h5>Some reasons I may have chosen a project:</h5>  <ul>   <li>I could <strong>potentially</strong> see myself investigating its usage someday. </li>    <li>It solved a problem in an interesting way. </li>    <li>Preferred small, focused, unique packages. </li>    <li>Preferred projects that were Open Source as in FREE.      <ul>       <li>Although I didn’t bother to look at any of the licenses so be sure to read into those before you use any yourself. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Preferred projects that have a “<strong>Project Site</strong>” where I could browse the source code see examples or even documentation.     <br /><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-xn_JwxZNUGU/TxylshXCQUI/AAAAAAAAATA/cECY7x7WnzI/s1600-h/image%25255B30%25255D.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-sXoFslcjE_c/Txyls-rcxuI/AAAAAAAAATI/X6ZPfYNGt_k/image_thumb%25255B15%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="138" height="98" /></a></li>    <li>For some reason if I saw it was hosted on GitHub I preferred those to sites that had their own dedicated location (Can’t explain why – just did…) </li> </ul>  <h5>Some reasons I may have NOT have chosen a project:</h5>  <ul>   <li>Tended to avoid projects that posted large numbers of packages even though many of them are still very good projects.    <br />EX:       <ul>       <li>NServiceBus </li>        <li>FubuMvc </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>For some reason I tended to stay away from anything MVC related. There are probably very interesting projects for MVC on there, but I probably avoided them because I’m not doing anything MVC related at the moment. </li>    <li>Avoided packages that had “utilities” or “common” or “helpers” in the package name.      <ul>       <li>But it might still be worthwhile checking out some of those open source “utility” projects. Just to get an idea of what others consider “needed on every project” and different approaches to the problems. </li>     </ul> <!--EndFragment--></li> </ul>  <h4>Some items to consider with these little NuGet gems.</h4>  <ul>   <li>Make sure you read and understand any license the project has before including or using them in your own work. </li>    <li>These posts won’t be full project analysis, but a generally a first impression.</li>    <li>Be sure to research any project before using. I’m only mentioning them because they piqued my interest. Not because I have extensive knowledge of the projects or know their stability.</li> </ul></div>

<p>Today the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_manager">PM</a> of a project I am working on sent an email with a small list of issues that we needed to get resolved before shipping an early build to the customer for a weekly review. In his list of issues MY NAME was tagged next to a feature that I KNOW was working. I dev’d it, tested, saw it work.</p>  <p>Now the project I’m working on encourages unit tested code, which is a fantastic project to be on since I am a big proponent of Unit/Integration/Automated tests. Heck I wrote a tool to help run them easier (<a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/">StatLight</a>).</p>  <h4>What I did.</h4>  <p>The problem was this. I dev’d a feature out in like 5 minutes, took about 2 seconds to decide if I should write a unit test to prove my feature worked and <b>this</b><b><i> </i></b><b>is where I failed</b>. Manually verified my change checked in the production code without its test and I was hurriedly moved on to the next task.</p>  <p>About 20 min later I get a quick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">I.M.</a> from a co-worker saying he had a small merge conflict in the file I just checked-in. Quickly told him how to get around his merge issue (not realizing after he checked in) that my “quick 5min dev task” was accidently removed in the merge.</p>  <h4>What I SHOULD have done!</h4>  <p>What I<b> should </b>have done was write the <strong>2 lines of test code first</strong>. <i>(you can argue test after/test first, I prefer test-first)</i>. Proven my code wasn’t working, by running the test, and then implement the 5 min feature making the test pass. Then when my co-worker ran into his merge issue.</p>  <p><img src="http://boldandfab.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/pow.jpg" width="179" height="126" /></p>  <p>Test would have failed telling him his merge didn’t go as planned.</p>  <h4>This would have also avoided</h4>  <ul>   <li>PM wouldn’t have had to discover the issue, Screenshot and write up an email. </li>    <li>I wouldn’t have had to peruse source control history to understand why my “working” feature wasn’t working. </li>    <li>I wouldn’t have had to willingly confess my sins in this post.</li> </ul>  <p>If your feature doesn’t have a coinciding automated test. How do you know it’s still working?</p>  <p>Happy Testing!</p>  </div>

<h4><a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/73869" target="_blank">Get The Build</a></h4>  <h4>What is StatLight?</h4>  <p><img src="http://download.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=statlight&amp;DownloadId=95275&amp;Build=18337" width="216" height="81" /></p>  <p>In short, it allows you to run your Silverlight tests on a Continuous Integration server or alongside your daily development.</p>  <p>Fore more information go check out the project site <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com">http://statlight.codeplex.com</a></p>  <h4>Some ramblings (about the project).</h4>  <p>It’s funny how the release cycle of this open source project has turned out. I don’t have any sort of calendar reminder that pops up saying “it’s been 4 or 5 months and time to get out a new release”. However, since I first open sourced the project I’ve put out a new release on a pretty consistent 4/5 month cycle and have done so since December 2009. It just so happens about every 4/5 months there is enough features and or fixes piled on top that It’s time to put out an “official” build. Not bad for a part time (free to the community) gig.</p>  <p>Thanks to the guys at <a href="http://codebetter.com/" target="_blank">CodeBetter</a> and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank">JetBrains</a> for giving us a <a href="http://teamcity.codebetter.com" target="_blank">TeamCity</a> build server, I put a build of StatLight up on their TeamCity server. This has been great for myself. When issues or feature request come in, all I have to do is dev them out, push the code out to GitHub and the <a href="http://teamcity.codebetter.com" target="_blank">TeamCity</a> build produces an artifact that people can pull down and use/test right away.</p>  <p><strong>What’s the difference between a TeamCity build and an “official” release of StatLight? </strong>To be honest, NOTHING. When I decide it’s time to release an “official” build, I head over to the TeamCity, download the latest build and throw it up on CodePlex and NuGet and call it the “official” release. I guess the biggest difference is this means I now have to go update the documentation out on the CodePlex site. I’m not particular happy with this process and hoping my new pet project using <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">http://sphinx.pocoo.org/</a> to generate a CHM documentation file will help with future versioning of the tool. I’m working on a new blog post for how I got this working…</p>  <h4>Some more ramblings (about this release)</h4>  <p>This build comes with some pretty major internal refactorings. Finally, after 3 years, I’ve put in an IOC container (really liking <a href="https://github.com/grumpydev/TinyIoC" target="_blank">TinyIOC</a> for this task). This cleaned up quite a bit of the codebase. Introduced a couple regressions, bug the community was great in helping me figure this out and I’ve beefed up my test coverage to avoid this in the future. There is more cleanup to do in the codebase, but much of the hard work was done and it’ll be small refactorings as I see them going forward.</p>  <h4>Some of this build’s highlights:</h4>  <p>I’d highly recommend reading the release notes on the download page to get a full list of features/fixes. <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/73869">http://statlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/73869</a></p>  <ul>   <li>Support for <a href="http://www.silverlight.net/learn/overview/what's-new-in-silverlight-5" target="_blank">Silverlight 5</a>. </li>    <li>Overhauled the “Continuous” mode. (Provide better U.I. and support for multiple xaps/dlls)      <ul>       <li>Note: I was getting a bug report that it could occasionally run a xap multiple times. Hopefully it’s fixed now, but if you see it and can reproduce it. <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/discussions" target="_blank">Let&#160; me know</a>. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>MSTest TRX output format. (Note: This was requested heavily, but when it was added I didn’t receive much feedback on whether it was working or not… So if you have issues, first start a <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/discussions" target="_blank">Discussion</a> or file an&#160; <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic" target="_blank">Issue</a>) </li> </ul>  <p>Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/brumfb" target="_blank">Bob Brumfield</a> for fixing a number of pathing issues after a directory re-structuring I made in the project. With his fixes we were able to get Silverlight 5 support into the project sooner than later.</p>  <h4>Sort-of known issue with this build.</h4>  <p>Due to the large scale refactoring that happened within StatLight I wouldn’t be surprised if a few regressions were introduced. Hopefully not as I’ve setup a large amount of automated tests around the project. But It’s hard to get everything.</p>  <p>I’ve had a few people report an issue with symptoms similar to the following.</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/discussions/284494">http://statlight.codeplex.com/discussions/284494</a></li>    <li><a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/workitem/14579">http://statlight.codeplex.com/workitem/14579</a></li> </ul>  <p>If you experience any sort of “<strong>Invalid or malformed application: check manifest</strong>” error. This is probably due to a StatLight web server side exception not being reported out correctly. Try downloading the latest from the TeamCity build (follow the link on the <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">StatLight</a> home page).</p>  <h4>What’s to come?</h4>  <p>If you feel brave, and <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/StatLight" target="_blank">clone the current codebase</a> you could get some early access to a version I have working with the <strong>Windows Phone Emulator</strong>. This was actually an early branch of the project I created many moons ago, and one that a user forked and added a couple fixes to a while back. I’ve since merged this into the main-line of StatLight.</p>  <p>This early version doesn’t yet support the full gamut of what StatLight’s Silverlight version supports, but I’m hoping to get it in there. It should work with the recent builds of the Microsoft.Silverlight.Testing that work on the phone. If you’re interested in helping out here, the big reason I don’t support most everything on the phone is related to the big <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/StatLight/blob/master/default.ps1" target="_blank">ol monster build script</a> in StatLight. I have to add some magic dust to this script and make dual compile other projects for both Silverlight and the phone. The codebase itself shouldn’t have to change much, but the build scripts and integration tests will require the majority of the effort.</p>  </div>

<p>If you haven’t heard of it, you’re about to be delighted. Every developer (at least those on Windows) should know about this project, if for nothing more than to make life setting up your dev machine a piece of cake.</p>  <h4>What is Chocolatey?</h4>  <p>Straight from the <a href="http://chocolatey.org">Chocolatey.org</a> site:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Chocolatey NuGet is a Machine Package Manager, somewhat like apt-get, but built with windows in mind.</p> </blockquote>  <p>If you’ve not ever used a linux machine or understand what the power of an “apt-get” like tool is, well It’s basically the simplest possible way to install an application to your machine. </p>  <p>What could be simpler than finding the app’s website, download the app, and next, next, next through the the installer? How about just typing “chocolaty install notepadplusplus” at a powershell command prompt? That simple little command will download and install Notepad++ right on your machine with virtually no need to interact with the installer. AWESOME!!!</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Disclaimer!</strong></p>    <p>I know there are other installer applications out there that aggregate and install different&#160; programs; however, to be honest, I don’t use any of them. I am also going to assume that most of them aren’t catered to the windows developer (maybe I’m wrong). Either way I like this project and I’m just trying to share it with the community. <strong>So There…</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>Ok, my above salesmanship is a little loud mouthy, but maybe your interest is peaked enough to give it a try.</p>  <h4>How do I install Chocolatey?</h4>  <p>It’s about as simple to install Chocolatey as it is to use Chocolatey to install other applications. One single powershell command. Just paste the below command in your powershell prompt and let er rip.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>First, make sure you have your powershell environment set to “Unrestricted”.<a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-4sSRlJeweTI/TozckReE5MI/AAAAAAAAASA/JG0ULKiPil0/s1600-h/image8.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-Vviqle2o908/TozclWiZ6TI/AAAAAAAAASE/1-_0QwA6KAs/image_thumb4.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="235" /></a></p> </blockquote>  <p>Run the Chocolatey install.</p>  <pre>  iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString(&quot;http://bit.ly/psChocInstall&quot;))</pre><br />  <h4>Packages!</h4>  <p>Now that you have chocolatey installed, head over to the <a href="http://Chocolatey.org">Chocolatey.org</a> website and browse the packages you can now install.</p>  <p>EX:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><font style="background-color: #ffffff">C:\Code&gt;<strong>chocolatey install notepadplusplus</strong></font></p> </blockquote>  <h4>How can I know when new packages are added to the Chocolatey.org feed?</h4>  <p>You can get more background on this approach by following my previous post <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2011/09/27/whats-happening-on-the-nuget-feed-leveraging-odata-in-an-rss-reader/" target="_blank">What’s happening on the NuGet feed (leveraging OData in an RSS reader)</a></p>  <p>The direct RSS link I have is as follows:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://chocolatey.org/api/feeds/Packages()?$filter=Id%20ne%20'SymbolSource.TestPackage'&amp;$orderby=Published%20desc">http://chocolatey.org/api/feeds/Packages()?$filter=Id%20ne%20&#8217;SymbolSource.TestPackage&#8217;&amp;$orderby=Published%20desc</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>Plug that into your RSS reader and you should be notified when new packages are added to the Chocolatey.org feed.</p>  <p>Happy Setting up your Dev Machine!</p></div>
