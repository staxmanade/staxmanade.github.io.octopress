<p>A while back I posted about <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2011/09/27/whats-happening-on-the-nuget-feed-leveraging-odata-in-an-rss-reader/" target="_blank">following the NuGet feed via an RSS reader</a>. For some strange reason I’ve been reviewing this feed since then on an almost daily basis in my RSS reader. Throughout that time I’ve kept a small list of what I think are interesting projects that have put out a release since that time. Today we’re going to start a journey through projects that I’ve found during my review of the feed. Some projects are interesting because I could find a use for them, some are interesting because they are unique, and others solve an interesting problem.</p>  <h4>Why were these packages chosen to post about over others?</h4>  <p>There wasn’t any scientific process in place to decide what projects made this list or not but as I think back over my time reviewing the feed, below are some items that came to mind.</p>  <h5>Some reasons I may have chosen a project:</h5>  <ul>   <li>I could <strong>potentially</strong> see myself investigating its usage someday. </li>    <li>It solved a problem in an interesting way. </li>    <li>Preferred small, focused, unique packages. </li>    <li>Preferred projects that were Open Source as in FREE.      <ul>       <li>Although I didn’t bother to look at any of the licenses so be sure to read into those before you use any yourself. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Preferred projects that have a “<strong>Project Site</strong>” where I could browse the source code see examples or even documentation.     <br /><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-xn_JwxZNUGU/TxylshXCQUI/AAAAAAAAATA/cECY7x7WnzI/s1600-h/image%25255B30%25255D.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-sXoFslcjE_c/Txyls-rcxuI/AAAAAAAAATI/X6ZPfYNGt_k/image_thumb%25255B15%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="138" height="98" /></a></li>    <li>For some reason if I saw it was hosted on GitHub I preferred those to sites that had their own dedicated location (Can’t explain why – just did…) </li> </ul>  <h5>Some reasons I may have NOT have chosen a project:</h5>  <ul>   <li>Tended to avoid projects that posted large numbers of packages even though many of them are still very good projects.    <br />EX:       <ul>       <li>NServiceBus </li>        <li>FubuMvc </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>For some reason I tended to stay away from anything MVC related. There are probably very interesting projects for MVC on there, but I probably avoided them because I’m not doing anything MVC related at the moment. </li>    <li>Avoided packages that had “utilities” or “common” or “helpers” in the package name.      <ul>       <li>But it might still be worthwhile checking out some of those open source “utility” projects. Just to get an idea of what others consider “needed on every project” and different approaches to the problems. </li>     </ul> <!--EndFragment--></li> </ul>  <h4>Some items to consider with these little NuGet gems.</h4>  <ul>   <li>Make sure you read and understand any license the project has before including or using them in your own work. </li>    <li>These posts won’t be full project analysis, but a generally a first impression.</li>    <li>Be sure to research any project before using. I’m only mentioning them because they piqued my interest. Not because I have extensive knowledge of the projects or know their stability.</li> </ul></div>

<p>Today the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_manager">PM</a> of a project I am working on sent an email with a small list of issues that we needed to get resolved before shipping an early build to the customer for a weekly review. In his list of issues MY NAME was tagged next to a feature that I KNOW was working. I dev’d it, tested, saw it work.</p>  <p>Now the project I’m working on encourages unit tested code, which is a fantastic project to be on since I am a big proponent of Unit/Integration/Automated tests. Heck I wrote a tool to help run them easier (<a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/">StatLight</a>).</p>  <h4>What I did.</h4>  <p>The problem was this. I dev’d a feature out in like 5 minutes, took about 2 seconds to decide if I should write a unit test to prove my feature worked and <b>this</b><b><i> </i></b><b>is where I failed</b>. Manually verified my change checked in the production code without its test and I was hurriedly moved on to the next task.</p>  <p>About 20 min later I get a quick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">I.M.</a> from a co-worker saying he had a small merge conflict in the file I just checked-in. Quickly told him how to get around his merge issue (not realizing after he checked in) that my “quick 5min dev task” was accidently removed in the merge.</p>  <h4>What I SHOULD have done!</h4>  <p>What I<b> should </b>have done was write the <strong>2 lines of test code first</strong>. <i>(you can argue test after/test first, I prefer test-first)</i>. Proven my code wasn’t working, by running the test, and then implement the 5 min feature making the test pass. Then when my co-worker ran into his merge issue.</p>  <p><img src="http://boldandfab.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/pow.jpg" width="179" height="126" /></p>  <p>Test would have failed telling him his merge didn’t go as planned.</p>  <h4>This would have also avoided</h4>  <ul>   <li>PM wouldn’t have had to discover the issue, Screenshot and write up an email. </li>    <li>I wouldn’t have had to peruse source control history to understand why my “working” feature wasn’t working. </li>    <li>I wouldn’t have had to willingly confess my sins in this post.</li> </ul>  <p>If your feature doesn’t have a coinciding automated test. How do you know it’s still working?</p>  <p>Happy Testing!</p>  </div>

<h4><a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/73869" target="_blank">Get The Build</a></h4>  <h4>What is StatLight?</h4>  <p><img src="http://download.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=statlight&amp;DownloadId=95275&amp;Build=18337" width="216" height="81" /></p>  <p>In short, it allows you to run your Silverlight tests on a Continuous Integration server or alongside your daily development.</p>  <p>Fore more information go check out the project site <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com">http://statlight.codeplex.com</a></p>  <h4>Some ramblings (about the project).</h4>  <p>It’s funny how the release cycle of this open source project has turned out. I don’t have any sort of calendar reminder that pops up saying “it’s been 4 or 5 months and time to get out a new release”. However, since I first open sourced the project I’ve put out a new release on a pretty consistent 4/5 month cycle and have done so since December 2009. It just so happens about every 4/5 months there is enough features and or fixes piled on top that It’s time to put out an “official” build. Not bad for a part time (free to the community) gig.</p>  <p>Thanks to the guys at <a href="http://codebetter.com/" target="_blank">CodeBetter</a> and <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank">JetBrains</a> for giving us a <a href="http://teamcity.codebetter.com" target="_blank">TeamCity</a> build server, I put a build of StatLight up on their TeamCity server. This has been great for myself. When issues or feature request come in, all I have to do is dev them out, push the code out to GitHub and the <a href="http://teamcity.codebetter.com" target="_blank">TeamCity</a> build produces an artifact that people can pull down and use/test right away.</p>  <p><strong>What’s the difference between a TeamCity build and an “official” release of StatLight? </strong>To be honest, NOTHING. When I decide it’s time to release an “official” build, I head over to the TeamCity, download the latest build and throw it up on CodePlex and NuGet and call it the “official” release. I guess the biggest difference is this means I now have to go update the documentation out on the CodePlex site. I’m not particular happy with this process and hoping my new pet project using <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">http://sphinx.pocoo.org/</a> to generate a CHM documentation file will help with future versioning of the tool. I’m working on a new blog post for how I got this working…</p>  <h4>Some more ramblings (about this release)</h4>  <p>This build comes with some pretty major internal refactorings. Finally, after 3 years, I’ve put in an IOC container (really liking <a href="https://github.com/grumpydev/TinyIoC" target="_blank">TinyIOC</a> for this task). This cleaned up quite a bit of the codebase. Introduced a couple regressions, bug the community was great in helping me figure this out and I’ve beefed up my test coverage to avoid this in the future. There is more cleanup to do in the codebase, but much of the hard work was done and it’ll be small refactorings as I see them going forward.</p>  <h4>Some of this build’s highlights:</h4>  <p>I’d highly recommend reading the release notes on the download page to get a full list of features/fixes. <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/73869">http://statlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/73869</a></p>  <ul>   <li>Support for <a href="http://www.silverlight.net/learn/overview/what's-new-in-silverlight-5" target="_blank">Silverlight 5</a>. </li>    <li>Overhauled the “Continuous” mode. (Provide better U.I. and support for multiple xaps/dlls)      <ul>       <li>Note: I was getting a bug report that it could occasionally run a xap multiple times. Hopefully it’s fixed now, but if you see it and can reproduce it. <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/discussions" target="_blank">Let&#160; me know</a>. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>MSTest TRX output format. (Note: This was requested heavily, but when it was added I didn’t receive much feedback on whether it was working or not… So if you have issues, first start a <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/discussions" target="_blank">Discussion</a> or file an&#160; <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/workitem/list/basic" target="_blank">Issue</a>) </li> </ul>  <p>Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/brumfb" target="_blank">Bob Brumfield</a> for fixing a number of pathing issues after a directory re-structuring I made in the project. With his fixes we were able to get Silverlight 5 support into the project sooner than later.</p>  <h4>Sort-of known issue with this build.</h4>  <p>Due to the large scale refactoring that happened within StatLight I wouldn’t be surprised if a few regressions were introduced. Hopefully not as I’ve setup a large amount of automated tests around the project. But It’s hard to get everything.</p>  <p>I’ve had a few people report an issue with symptoms similar to the following.</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/discussions/284494">http://statlight.codeplex.com/discussions/284494</a></li>    <li><a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/workitem/14579">http://statlight.codeplex.com/workitem/14579</a></li> </ul>  <p>If you experience any sort of “<strong>Invalid or malformed application: check manifest</strong>” error. This is probably due to a StatLight web server side exception not being reported out correctly. Try downloading the latest from the TeamCity build (follow the link on the <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">StatLight</a> home page).</p>  <h4>What’s to come?</h4>  <p>If you feel brave, and <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/StatLight" target="_blank">clone the current codebase</a> you could get some early access to a version I have working with the <strong>Windows Phone Emulator</strong>. This was actually an early branch of the project I created many moons ago, and one that a user forked and added a couple fixes to a while back. I’ve since merged this into the main-line of StatLight.</p>  <p>This early version doesn’t yet support the full gamut of what StatLight’s Silverlight version supports, but I’m hoping to get it in there. It should work with the recent builds of the Microsoft.Silverlight.Testing that work on the phone. If you’re interested in helping out here, the big reason I don’t support most everything on the phone is related to the big <a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/StatLight/blob/master/default.ps1" target="_blank">ol monster build script</a> in StatLight. I have to add some magic dust to this script and make dual compile other projects for both Silverlight and the phone. The codebase itself shouldn’t have to change much, but the build scripts and integration tests will require the majority of the effort.</p>  </div>

<p>If you haven’t heard of it, you’re about to be delighted. Every developer (at least those on Windows) should know about this project, if for nothing more than to make life setting up your dev machine a piece of cake.</p>  <h4>What is Chocolatey?</h4>  <p>Straight from the <a href="http://chocolatey.org">Chocolatey.org</a> site:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Chocolatey NuGet is a Machine Package Manager, somewhat like apt-get, but built with windows in mind.</p> </blockquote>  <p>If you’ve not ever used a linux machine or understand what the power of an “apt-get” like tool is, well It’s basically the simplest possible way to install an application to your machine. </p>  <p>What could be simpler than finding the app’s website, download the app, and next, next, next through the the installer? How about just typing “chocolaty install notepadplusplus” at a powershell command prompt? That simple little command will download and install Notepad++ right on your machine with virtually no need to interact with the installer. AWESOME!!!</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Disclaimer!</strong></p>    <p>I know there are other installer applications out there that aggregate and install different&#160; programs; however, to be honest, I don’t use any of them. I am also going to assume that most of them aren’t catered to the windows developer (maybe I’m wrong). Either way I like this project and I’m just trying to share it with the community. <strong>So There…</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>Ok, my above salesmanship is a little loud mouthy, but maybe your interest is peaked enough to give it a try.</p>  <h4>How do I install Chocolatey?</h4>  <p>It’s about as simple to install Chocolatey as it is to use Chocolatey to install other applications. One single powershell command. Just paste the below command in your powershell prompt and let er rip.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>First, make sure you have your powershell environment set to “Unrestricted”.<a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-4sSRlJeweTI/TozckReE5MI/AAAAAAAAASA/JG0ULKiPil0/s1600-h/image8.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-Vviqle2o908/TozclWiZ6TI/AAAAAAAAASE/1-_0QwA6KAs/image_thumb4.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="235" /></a></p> </blockquote>  <p>Run the Chocolatey install.</p>  <pre>  iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString(&quot;http://bit.ly/psChocInstall&quot;))</pre><br />  <h4>Packages!</h4>  <p>Now that you have chocolatey installed, head over to the <a href="http://Chocolatey.org">Chocolatey.org</a> website and browse the packages you can now install.</p>  <p>EX:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><font style="background-color: #ffffff">C:\Code&gt;<strong>chocolatey install notepadplusplus</strong></font></p> </blockquote>  <h4>How can I know when new packages are added to the Chocolatey.org feed?</h4>  <p>You can get more background on this approach by following my previous post <a href="http://elegantcode.com/2011/09/27/whats-happening-on-the-nuget-feed-leveraging-odata-in-an-rss-reader/" target="_blank">What’s happening on the NuGet feed (leveraging OData in an RSS reader)</a></p>  <p>The direct RSS link I have is as follows:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://chocolatey.org/api/feeds/Packages()?$filter=Id%20ne%20'SymbolSource.TestPackage'&amp;$orderby=Published%20desc">http://chocolatey.org/api/feeds/Packages()?$filter=Id%20ne%20&#8217;SymbolSource.TestPackage&#8217;&amp;$orderby=Published%20desc</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>Plug that into your RSS reader and you should be notified when new packages are added to the Chocolatey.org feed.</p>  <p>Happy Setting up your Dev Machine!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<p>Ever since <a href="http://nuget.org/" target="_blank">NuGet</a> came online I’ve been wanting a way to find out about new packages, and updates to packages.</p>  <p>Since <a href="http://www.odata.org/" target="_blank">OData</a> extends the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt" target="_blank">ATOM</a> feed and you can hook an OData feed up to any RSS reader I set out to find a way to get at those recent updates to the NuGet feed and find out when new packages were published.</p>  <p>If you’re not completely familiar with OData, later in this post I explain how I arrived at the URL below. However, if you don’t care how I arrived at the solution, below is the final RSS link I’m currently using in my RSS reader (Google Reader) to monitor updates to the NuGet feed.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://packages.nuget.org/v1/FeedService.svc/Packages()?$filter=Id%20ne%20'SymbolSource.TestPackage'&amp;$orderby=Published%20desc">http://packages.nuget.org/v1/FeedService.svc/Packages()?$filter=Id%20ne%20&#8217;SymbolSource.TestPackage&#8217;&amp;$orderby=Published%20desc</a></p> </blockquote>  <h4>How did I discover or build that URL?</h4>  <p>I could have memorized the <a href="http://www.odata.org/developers/protocols/uri-conventions">OData URI spec</a> and constructed the above link by hand but I’m far more familiar with C# and LINQ and instead used <a href="http://www.linqpad.net/">LINQPad</a>.</p>  <p>Open up LINQPad and add a WCF Data Services (OData) connection to the following URL</p>  <blockquote>   <p><a href="http://packages.nuget.org/v1/FeedService.svc">http://packages.nuget.org/v1/FeedService.svc</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>Now You can query the OData feed with some LINQ.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>from p in Packages      <br />where p.Id != &quot;SymbolSource.TestPackage&quot;       <br />orderby p.Published descending       <br />select p</p> </blockquote>  <p>When you execute this LINQ query in LINQPad, you can click on the “SQL” in the results pane to view the URL that was generated to execute the operation.</p>  <p>Now my original linq expression didn’t have the <u>where p.Id != &quot;SymbolSource.TestPackage&quot;</u> as I didn’t know this package would become a regular pain to view in the RSS Reader.</p>  <p>One great thing about OData is the ability to re-craft the URL for this feed to ignore items that either show up so much that I want to exclude them (like the “SymbolSource.TestPackage”) or a certain class of items that I just don’t want to be alerted on (maybe filtering by the NuGet Tag property).</p>  <h4>Some observations of the feed.</h4>  <p>I’ve been monitoring this feed for almost a month now and have learned about some very interesting projects, check the next section of this post with a list of some of the more interesting ones (to me) that I’ve found. </p>  <p>So far the feed has become just a regular part of my daily blog reading. It’s the quickest one to do as I’m typically skimming the titles of the RSS items and only slowing down to dig into projects I’ve never heard and sound interesting.</p>  <p>Google Reader trends that this feed generates about 54 items a day. Which may seem like a lot, but it’s really easy to click the “mark all as read” button and go on with the day.<a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-XUsrxaG8wXs/ToHZKwn3O4I/AAAAAAAAARo/JYWHnb03aLc/s1600-h/image9.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-SsuwC_xx4Bk/ToHZLMw-2oI/AAAAAAAAARs/YW-Bk2zGg0k/image_thumb5.png?imgmax=800" width="587" height="87" /></a></p>  <h4>Interesting projects I’ve discovered.</h4>  <p>I’ve been watching this RSS feed for almost 2 weeks now, and have discovered some new projects (at least new to me) and learned about updates to projects I already knew about.</p>  <p>Below is a small list of ones I thought were interesting – there’s way more being done out there.</p>  <h5>New to me</h5>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/OpenCover" target="_blank">OpenCover</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/nji" target="_blank">NodeJs (Package) Installer</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/SignalR" target="_blank">SignalR</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/FastActivator" target="_blank">FastActivator</a> (this one feels like it could be a single .cs file instead of a full assembly – but then I guess you couldn’t leverage it in say a VB or F# project) </li>    <li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/EasyHttp" target="_blank">EasyHttp</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/SheepAspect">SheepAspect</a> </li> </ul>  <h5>NOT new to me (but released while I was watching)</h5>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/SassAndCoffee" target="_blank">SassAndCoffee</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/FubuMVC">FubuMVC</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Bottles">Bottles</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://nuget.org/List/Packages/StatLight" target="_blank">StatLight</a> (Ya I know it’s my project – but good verification that when I released the project – it showed up in my <u>RSS </u>reader.) <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-jgUk-cdtfpU/ToHZLfUUubI/AAAAAAAAARw/lPMBrU8QmB8/wlEmoticon-smile2.png?imgmax=800" /> </li> </ul>  <h4>Could NuGet be a new metric for what’s popular or up and coming?</h4>  <p>That heading is a little bolder than what I actually think, mostly because there are far too many variables to make that statement hold a strong footing. Regardless, I have noticed some interesting “trends” (if you can define a trend by my watching the feed for about a month) in what is being released on NuGet and wonder if watching this over time will be a nice window in to the types of projects people are really working on.</p>  <p>I’ve seen quite a few projects related to messaging or <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html" target="_blank">Event Sourcing</a>. And a number of different JS and CSS minification/build tooling projects.</p>  </div>

Thanks for sharing. I wasn&#39;t aware, that existing RSS readers would actually be able to understand OData, even though it&#39;s an extension to Atom.<br /><br />By the way, there&#39;s already a project for watching NuGet packages through RSS here: <a href="http://nugetfeed.org" rel="nofollow">NuGetFeed.org</a>.<br /><br />With NuGetFeed.org you will be able to follow your favorite NuGet packages through RSS. There&#39;s a feature called MyFeed, where you will be able to add a list of packages you want to follow. If you use Google Chrome, there&#39;s an extension as well and finally a Visual Studio add-in is also available. Hope you will find NuGetFeed.org useful.</div>

<p>I’m not so sure this fits in the “elegant code” theme, but it’s a “fun with code” topic that someone might enjoy. Especially if you have a little one.</p>  <p>My 4yr old is learning how to spell small and simple words like her name, “Mom”, “Dad”, etc, and continuing her exploration with letters on the keyboard. She’s been banging on a keyboard since her early years on <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/babysmash/">babysmash</a>. In fact I came home one day to find my monitor turned 90 degrees and about every possible admin window open in the background because of certain key combinations were not trapped by babysmash. But I digress…</p>  <p>For a while she was typing some text into notepad and asking me what it spelled. </p>  <blockquote>   <p><font style="background-color: #ffffff">“ajlkjwelsl” –&gt; What’s that spell daddy?</font></p> </blockquote>  <p>I then thought it would be fun if the computer could give instant feedback about what she typed and in a matter of a minute or so I whipped up this little “game” which we had fun playing for a bit.</p>  <p>You can view the gist here - <a href="https://gist.github.com/1180060">https://gist.github.com/1180060</a></p>  <p><code></code></p>  <p>Just paste the function above as shown below and run it. Type some text (<strong>make sure your computer’s sound is on</strong>) and press enter to hear it.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-LEdccB9P5Lg/Tl8Z0vb_LaI/AAAAAAAAARU/kyFyM3CCU-o/s1600-h/image4.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-WtEbt7GLNSI/Tl8Z07lC9dI/AAAAAAAAARY/2zWzewZtjjc/image_thumb2.png?imgmax=800" width="636" height="390" /></a></p>  <p>I typed some of the usual things we say around the house and my 4yr old wouldn’t stop laughing… </p>  <p>Give it a try with your little ones (or big ones). Even let your non-techie significant other have a go – he/she may have some fun with it.</p>  </div>

<h3>Background</h3>In my previous job, I spent all my development time in a Linux environment. Was rather impressed at how much could get done at the command line, and how efficient some of those tasks became. My next job was based on Windows and mostly the Microsoft stack of development tools. This&nbsp; meant I pretty much left the command line behind. That was, until, I started using git. And since I wanted to learn PowerShell, I used PowerShell to execute my git commands.<br />One thing that has bugged me for a while is simply moving between directories. Even with tab completion, all that typing is a still quite annoying. Especially if you jump between a set of similar directories. One feature from the Linux CD command that I missed was “CD -&#8220;. This command in Linux can be used to jump to the previous directory (and then back again). One limitation of this command is it only could jump back to the previous directory, and it did not retain a memory of recent directories. <em>There may be something better in Linux that I don’t know of, but I’m basing this on a limited experience a number of years ago.</em><br />So I threw a question out on twitter.    <br /><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-Ucrl4yvnrIk/TiJJ_Nnk3eI/AAAAAAAAAQI/k5Mm8x_Twhs/s1600-h/image_thumb63.png"><img alt="image_thumb6" border="0" height="97" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-iijA6mLrgEU/TiJJ_Xbp0hI/AAAAAAAAAQM/lHv0bksIGys/image_thumb6_thumb.png?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="image_thumb6" width="318" /></a>     <br />After several tweets back and forth, @cwprogram threw an interesting spike at me.<br /><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-ilEGIJk7VRI/TiJJ_kt8a-I/AAAAAAAAAQQ/XJ0iAJq5384/s1600-h/image_thumb942.png"><img alt="image_thumb9[4]" border="0" height="97" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-T4MVc7vKolw/TiJKACBtvyI/AAAAAAAAAQU/Pn71WMECKcQ/image_thumb94_thumb.png?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="image_thumb9[4]" width="312" /></a>&nbsp; <a href="http://pastebin.com/xwtkn0am">http://pastebin.com/xwtkn0am</a>     <br />Although this wasn’t exactly what I was looking for, it contained enough of what I needed to spark my curiosity to write a version of my own.<br />And so a little script was born that I’m now using to replace the “CD” command in my PowerShell runtime.<br /><h3>What does this do?</h3>After you get it installed (see install steps below), when you type “CD” with no parameters at the command prompt. It will list up to 10 of the most recent distinct paths you’ve been to recently. This list also gives an index lookup number that you can use as a shortcut to jump to that path.<br />Example:<br /><blockquote><span style="font-family: Courier New;">C:\code&gt; cd        <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) C:\Users\jasonj         <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) D:\temp         <br />C:\code&gt; cd 2         <br />D:\temp&gt;</span></blockquote>You can continue to use the “CD” command to do your usual changing directories. Now you can quickly get a history of where you’ve been, and quickly jump to any of those previous histories without typing the entire paths again.<br />It defaults to only showing you the last 10 distinct items, but if you find yourself needing to go back farther than that, you can use the following command to list more than 10 items.<br /><blockquote>D:\temp&gt; cd -ShowCount 100</blockquote><h3>How to Install</h3><ol><li>Download the file and save it to a location you can reference later.      <br /><a href="https://github.com/staxmanade/DevMachineSetup/blob/master/GlobalScripts/Change-Directory.ps1">https://github.com/staxmanade/DevMachineSetup/blob/master/GlobalScripts/Change-Directory.ps1</a> </li><li>Open your $PROFILE (<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/50236/customizing-your-powershell-profile/">What is that?</a>) </li><li>Type the following two commands into your profile to replace the existing “CD” command with the new one.      <br />      <br /><span style="font-family: Courier New;">Remove-Item alias:cd        <br />Set-Alias cd {Your_Saved_Directory}\Change-Directory.ps1</span>       </li><li>Exit your PowerShell console and start a new one up. </li></ol><br />Happy Commanding!</div>

If you want some more *nix features, including cd - you may want to look at pscx.codeplex.com - I made mistake of ignoring what it has to offer and also re-invented cd- in my module. ;) IMO pscx should be added to win build by default. ;)</div>

<p>It’s been a while since I blogged about any updates to the StatLight project and even though people are saying “SilverLight’s dead” I’d have to say there’s been more community contribution in the last few months to the project than there’s ever been.</p>  <h4>What is StatLight?</h4>  <p>For those of you who don’t know, it’s a simple little command line tool you can use to execute tests for SilverLight test projects. You can get some more information on the project at the <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/">project’s home page</a> and <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/documentation">documentation page</a>.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h4>Release of <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/62509">StatLight 1.4</a></h4>  <p>It’s been several months since I posted the 1.4 release of StatLight. It was full of all kinds of goodies. Go checkout the release page to see what updates were included.</p>  <p>There was a regression introduced with this release that caused U.I. tests in TeamCity to not report correctly. It’s since been fixed and you can use the <a href="http://teamcity.codebetter.com/viewType.html?tab=buildTypeStatusDiv&amp;buildTypeId=bt370">CodeBetter TeamCity</a> server to pull down the latest build of StatLight if you need this fix. If you hit the login page, just click on the login as a guest link to access the TeamCity builds.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h4>Release of <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/releases/view/68996">StatLight 1.5</a> (soon, maybe, sometime)</h4>  <p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-auqyO7rhKbk/Th9hIpJe4cI/AAAAAAAAAP8/DQCqSPMEboc/s1600-h/image%25255B10%25255D.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="right" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-XlOPMINnLiY/Th9hJAXFFaI/AAAAAAAAAQA/TiEM4PvpvZ0/image_thumb%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="244" height="120" /></a>If you are interested in what is to come with the next release, you can head over to the “planned” tab and check out some of the new features.</p>  <p>But I’ll write about some of them here anyway <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout" alt="Smile with tongue out" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-McDDdxnanho/Th9hJeECyEI/AAAAAAAAAQE/EKmKN-TTSK0/wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800" /></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h4>Community Contribution.</h4>  <h5>xUnitContrib Test Runner</h5>  <p>I’d like to say thanks to <a href="https://github.com/remogloor">Remo Gloor</a> for his contribution of the official xUnitContrib Silverlight test runner. Remo created a StatLight runner host that leverages the xUnitcontrib Silverlight test runner to execute xUnit tests. This provides some great xUnit support and is considerably faster than the xUnitLight adapter originally implemented.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h5>Growl Plugin</h5>  <p>Geir-Tore Lindsve leveraged the new <a href="http://statlight.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Extensibility%20Documentation&amp;referringTitle=Documentation">extensibility</a> model recently added to StatLight to create a plugin that would notify Growl of failing tests. You can check out the project at <a title="https://github.com/lindsve/Statlight.Growl" href="https://github.com/lindsve/Statlight.Growl">https://github.com/lindsve/Statlight.Growl</a></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h5>ReSharper 6</h5>  <p>ReSharper support has been around for a while now with the <a href="http://agunit.codeplex.com/">AgUnit</a> project. I was recently contacted by Steven Kock who wanted to see if it were possible to dump his custom Silverlight Test runner and leverage StatLight. I’ve been working with him on this, and am really excited about the value add we get from having Steven push StatLight around. Looking forward to his suggestions, and who knows – we may get some much better performance out of StatLight. Even though it’s still under dev, I’m just stoked can’t say how awesome it was to open up a Silverlight test project and execute a single test by using my R# shortcut.</p>  </div>
